Call transfers allow you to seamlessly move conversations between AI agents and human operators, or between different AI agents with specialized capabilities.

## When to Use Call Transfers

**Escalation to Human Agents:**
- Customer requests to speak with a human
- AI agent encounters a complex issue beyond its capabilities
- Sensitive situations requiring human empathy
- Legal or compliance issues

**Specialized AI Agents:**
- Transfer to domain-specific agents (billing, technical support, sales)
- Route to agents with different language capabilities
- Hand off to agents with different tools or knowledge bases

**Departmental Routing:**
- Route calls to appropriate departments based on customer needs
- Transfer between business units or specialties
- Queue management for busy periods

## How Call Transfers Work

1. **AI agent identifies** the need for transfer during conversation
2. **Transfer tool is invoked** with destination details
3. **Current call is placed on hold** (optional)
4. **New call is established** to the transfer destination
5. **Calls are bridged** or handed off completely
6. **Original call ends** or continues based on transfer type

## Built-in Transfer Tool

Ultravox provides a built-in `transfer` tool for handling call transfers. Enable it when creating your call:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    systemPrompt: `You are a customer service agent. If a customer asks to speak with a human or if you encounter an issue you cannot resolve, use the transfer tool to connect them with a human agent.`,
    selectedTools: [
      { "toolName": "transfer" }
    ],
    medium: { "twilio": {} },
    firstSpeaker: "FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT"
  })
});
```

## Transfer Tool Usage

The transfer tool accepts these parameters:

```javascript
// Example transfer tool invocation
{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",  // Required: destination phone number
  "description": "Transferring you to our billing department"  // Optional: explanation
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `phoneNumber`: The phone number to transfer the call to
- `description`: Optional message explaining the transfer to the caller

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Human Escalation

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a customer service AI assistant. Help customers with their questions and issues.

If a customer:
- Explicitly asks to speak with a human
- Has a complex issue you cannot resolve
- Seems frustrated or upset
- Has account-specific problems requiring verification

Use the transfer tool to connect them with a human agent at +1-555-0123.

Always explain what you're doing: "I'm going to transfer you to one of our human agents who can better assist you."
`;

const callConfig = {
  systemPrompt,
  selectedTools: [{ "toolName": "transfer" }],
  medium: { "twilio": {} },
  firstSpeaker: "FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT"
};
```

### Department-Specific Transfers

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a customer service AI assistant. Route customers to the appropriate department:

- For billing questions: Transfer to +1-555-0100 (billing department)
- For technical support: Transfer to +1-555-0200 (tech support)  
- For sales inquiries: Transfer to +1-555-0300 (sales team)
- For general complaints: Transfer to +1-555-0400 (customer relations)

Always explain which department you're transferring them to and why.

Examples:
- "I'm transferring you to our billing department who can help with payment questions."
- "Let me connect you with our technical support team who specializes in this issue."
`;

const callConfig = {
  systemPrompt,
  selectedTools: [{ "toolName": "transfer" }],
  medium: { "twilio": {} },
  firstSpeaker: "FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT"
};
```

### Conditional Transfers Based on Business Hours

```javascript
const currentHour = new Date().getHours();
const isBusinessHours = currentHour >= 9 && currentHour < 17;

const systemPrompt = isBusinessHours 
  ? `
    You are a customer service AI assistant. For complex issues or when customers request human help, transfer them to our live agents at +1-555-0123.
    
    Say: "I'm connecting you with one of our human agents who is available now."
  `
  : `
    You are an after-hours customer service AI assistant. Our human agents are currently unavailable (business hours: 9 AM - 5 PM).
    
    Try to resolve issues yourself. If you cannot help, offer to:
    1. Take a detailed message for follow-up during business hours
    2. Schedule a callback for tomorrow
    3. Transfer to our 24/7 emergency line (+1-555-0911) for urgent issues only
    
    Only use the transfer tool for true emergencies during off-hours.
  `;

const callConfig = {
  systemPrompt,
  selectedTools: [{ "toolName": "transfer" }],
  medium: { "twilio": {} },
  firstSpeaker: "FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT"
};
```

## Advanced Transfer Patterns

### Warm Transfers with Context
Provide context to the receiving agent:

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a customer service AI assistant. When transferring calls, always provide context.

Before transferring, gather:
- Customer name and account number (if available)
- Brief description of their issue
- Any troubleshooting steps already attempted
- Customer's preferred resolution

Then say: "I'm going to transfer you to [department/agent name]. I'll make sure they have all the details about your [brief issue description] so you don't have to repeat everything."

Use the transfer tool with a description that includes the context.

Example: "Transferring customer John Smith (account #12345) to billing. Issue: wants to dispute $50 charge from last month. Already verified account details."
`;
```

### Priority-Based Routing

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a customer service AI assistant. Route customers based on their issue priority:

HIGH PRIORITY (transfer to +1-555-0911):
- Service outages affecting business operations
- Billing disputes over $1000
- Security concerns or suspected fraud
- VIP customer accounts (ask for account level)

NORMAL PRIORITY (transfer to +1-555-0123):
- General account questions
- Standard billing inquiries
- Product information requests
- Technical support for non-critical issues

Always ask about the urgency and impact of the issue before deciding on transfer priority.
`;
```

### Multi-Language Support

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a multilingual customer service AI assistant. If customers prefer to speak in a language other than English:

- Spanish: Transfer to +1-555-0150 (Spanish support)
- French: Transfer to +1-555-0160 (French support)  
- German: Transfer to +1-555-0170 (German support)

Say: "I'm connecting you with an agent who speaks [language] fluently."

If the requested language isn't available, explain our available options and offer to continue in English or schedule a callback when a [language] speaker is available.
`;
```

## Provider-Specific Considerations

### Twilio
Twilio handles transfers through their call control API. The transfer tool will:
1. Place the current call on hold
2. Dial the destination number
3. Bridge the calls when answered

### Telnyx
Telnyx supports call transfers through their call control commands:
1. Current call is held
2. New call leg is created to destination
3. Calls are bridged upon answer

### Plivo
Plivo handles transfers through their call transfer API:
1. Original call is placed on hold
2. Transfer call is initiated
3. Bridge occurs when destination answers

### jambonz
jambonz supports transfers through their transfer verb:
1. Current session is held
2. New call is placed to destination
3. Sessions are bridged or replaced

## Error Handling

Handle transfer failures gracefully:

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a customer service AI assistant with transfer capabilities.

If a transfer fails (busy, no answer, etc.):
1. Apologize for the inconvenience
2. Offer alternatives:
   - Try again in a few minutes
   - Leave a detailed message for callback
   - Schedule a specific callback time
   - Provide direct contact information
   - Continue helping with the AI assistant

Example response: "I'm sorry, but our agents are currently busy. I can either try the transfer again in a few minutes, take a detailed message for a callback, or continue helping you myself. What would you prefer?"

Always remain helpful and offer multiple options when transfers fail.
`;
```

## Transfer Analytics and Monitoring

Track transfer patterns to improve your service:

```javascript
// Monitor transfer usage
app.post('/ultravox/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { event, call } = req.body;
  
  if (event === 'call.ended') {
    // Check if transfers were used during the call
    const transfers = call.transcript?.filter(msg => 
      msg.text?.includes('transfer tool')
    ) || [];
    
    if (transfers.length > 0) {
      // Log transfer metrics
      logTransferMetrics({
        callId: call.id,
        transferCount: transfers.length,
        callDuration: call.duration,
        outcome: call.outcome
      });
    }
  }
  
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

async function logTransferMetrics(metrics) {
  // Save to your analytics system
  await saveToAnalytics('call_transfers', {
    ...metrics,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
}
```

## Best Practices

### When to Transfer
- **Be proactive**: Transfer before customers get frustrated
- **Set clear expectations**: Explain what the human agent can do that you cannot
- **Gather information**: Collect relevant details before transferring
- **Confirm intent**: Make sure the customer actually wants to be transferred

### Transfer Communication
- **Explain the process**: "I'm going to connect you with..."
- **Set expectations**: "This may take a moment..."
- **Provide context**: Brief the receiving agent about the issue
- **Follow up**: Ensure the transfer was successful

### System Design
- **Fallback options**: Always have alternatives if transfers fail
- **Queue management**: Consider wait times and agent availability
- **Context preservation**: Pass relevant information to receiving agents
- **Monitoring**: Track transfer success rates and customer satisfaction

## Testing Transfers

### Development Testing
1. **Set up test phone numbers** for different departments
2. **Use test scenarios** to trigger transfers
3. **Monitor call flows** to ensure proper handoffs
4. **Test failure cases** (busy, no answer, invalid numbers)

### Production Monitoring
1. **Track transfer success rates**
2. **Monitor customer satisfaction** after transfers
3. **Analyze transfer patterns** to identify improvement opportunities
4. **Alert on transfer failures** for quick resolution
