Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables Ultravox agents to connect with your existing phone systems and SIP clients. This guide explains how to set up both incoming and outgoing SIP calls with Ultravox agents.

## SIP Quickstart

The fastest way to start using SIP with Ultravox:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Agent">Create an agent using the [Ultravox Realtime console](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents).</Step>
  <Step title="Create a SIP Call">Create an agent call using the [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) API and use the `sip` medium.</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  <b>API Key Required</b>
  <br />
  Make sure you have an Ultravox API key. You can create one in the [console](https://app.ultravox.ai/settings/).
</Note>

## SIP Overview

Ultravox uses a `medium` for each call, which defines how the call will occur. When using `sip` as the medium, you can connect your Ultravox agents with standard SIP-compatible systems.

You can create a SIP call with the Ultravox Realtime [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) or [Create Call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoints using the `sip` medium.

The `sip` medium supports the creation of both incoming and outgoing calls.

### Incoming SIP Calls
Incoming calls are initiated by a SIP client to your Ultravox agent. When the Ultravox incoming SIP call is created, the returned join URL is a SIP URI to which an invite can be sent.


### Outgoing SIP Calls
Outgoing calls are when Ultravox initiates the call to a SIP endpoint or client. The configuration varies slightly depending on which SIP client/system you're using.

When creating an outbound SIP call, Ultravox will initiate the call directly and no join URL will be returned. 


## Create an Outgoing SIP Call

For outgoing SIP calls, you'll need to add the `outgoing` configuration data for the `sip` medium and add it to the request body of the [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) or [Create Call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) request:

```js
medium: {
  sip: {
    outgoing: {
      to: "sip:<destination>@<sip_domain>",
      from: "<your_identifier>",
      username: "<authentication_username>",
      password: "<authentication_password>"
    }
  }
}
```

### Outgoing SIP Parameters
<ParamField body="to" type="string" required>
  The target SIP URL to which the Ultravox call will connect.
  
  Examples:
  `sip:username@domain`, `sip:+15551234567@carrier.com`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="from" type="string" required>
  The caller identifier. Must conform to what your SIP trunk allows.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="username" type="string">
  Optional. Username for connecting to your SIP trunk.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="password" type="string">
  Optional. Password for connecting to your SIP trunk.
</ParamField>

### Linphone Example

```js Example: Creating an Outgoing SIP Call to Linphone
    medium: {
      sip: {
        outgoing: {
          to: "sip:<username>@sip.linphone.org",
          from: "<company_name>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Create an Incoming SIP Call

For incoming SIP calls, you'll need to use `incoming` for the `sip` medium and add it to the request body of the [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) or [Create Call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) request. This will return a `joinUrl` that can be used to connect to a SIP client.

```js Example: Creating an Incoming SIP Call
medium: {
  sip: {
    incoming: {}
  }
}
```

## Supported Codecs
<Info>
  Incoming SIP currently only supports PCMA and PCMU. Other codecs are coming soon.
</Info>

Ultravox Realtime supports wideband (AKA "HD audio") and narrowband SIP via various codecs:

### Wideband Codecs (Recommended)
| Codec | Audio Quality | Outgoing SIP | Incoming SIP |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| G.722 | HD (16kHz) | ✅ | Coming Soon |
| G.722.1 | HD (16kHz) | ✅ | Coming Soon |
| G.722.2 | HD (16kHz) | ✅ | Coming Soon |
| Opus | Premium HD (48kHz) | ✅ | Coming Soon |

### Narrowband Codecs (Legacy Support)
| Codec | Audio Quality | Outgoing SIP | Incoming SIP |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| G.711 (PCMU/u-law) | Standard (8kHz) | ✅ | ✅ |
| G.711 (PCMA/a-law) | Standard (8kHz) | ✅ | ✅ |
| iLBC | Standard (8kHz) | ✅ | Coming Soon |

Using any other codec will cause calls to fail.
