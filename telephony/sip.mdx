Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables Ultravox agents to connect with your existing phone systems and SIP clients. This guide explains how to set up both incoming and outgoing SIP calls with Ultravox agents.

## SIP Quickstart

The fastest way to start using SIP with Ultravox:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Agent">Create an agent using the [Ultravox Realtime console](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents).</Step>
  <Step title="Create a SIP Call">Create an agent call using the [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) API and use the `sip` medium.</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  <b>API Key Required</b>
  <br />
  Make sure you have an Ultravox API key. You can create one in the [console](https://app.ultravox.ai/settings/).
</Note>

## Incoming SIP Calls
For incoming calls, you can configure Ultravox to accept calls from your SIP system then send a sip invite directly to your agent. The SIP invite will create an Ultravox call and connect to it, no other requests required.

Ultravox supports two setups for incoming SIP calls: IP allowlisting and SIP registration. IP allowlisting works well with dedicated PBX systems, while SIP registration is recommended for cloud PBX setups.

In either setup, you can choose to allow incoming calls to all of your agents or to specific agents only. Calls will be created automatically from your agent's call template when a SIP invite is received.

### IP Allowlisting
To set up IP Allowlisting, use the [sip configuration API](/api-reference/sip/sip-partial-update) to add your SIP system's public IP addresses to the `allowedCidrRanges` list. Entries in this list must be IPv4 [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) ranges, e.g. `0.0.0.0/0` for any IP address (not recommended) or `91.200.160.14/32` for the single `91.200.160.14` IP address.

Once your SIP system's IP address(es) are allowed, you can have them send SIP invites to your agents using the pattern `agent_{agent_id}@{your_account_sip_domain}`. The value for `{your_account_sip_domain}` is available when you [view your SIP configuration](/api-reference/sip/sip-get).

### SIP Registration
In the registration model, Ultravox acts as a SIP client (similar to a softphone) and registers with your SIP server as the user you specify. To set this up, you'll need to create a user in your PBX, configure your PBX to send relevant calls to that user, and then [create a registration](/api-reference/sip/sip-registrations-create) for that user in Ultravox.

When creating a registration, you'll need to provide the following information:
* `username`: The username of the user you created in your PBX.
* `password`: The password for that user.
* `proxy`: The domain or IP address of your SIP server.

### Personalizing the Call
Many parts of an agent can use context to personalize a call. (See [Call Template Configuration](/agents/building-and-editing-agents#call-template-configuration).) You can use SIP headers to populate template context for incoming SIP calls. Each header value is interpretted as JSON to allow for complex values.

For example including the headers `X-Customer-Name: Bob` and `X-Complex-Value: {"subkey": "value"}` becomes `{"customer_name": "Bob", "complex_value": {"subkey": "value"}}`.

## Outgoing SIP Calls
For outgoing calls, you can create a SIP call with Ultravox Realtime [Create Agent Call](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post) or [Create Call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoints using the `sip` medium with `outgoing` property.

```js
medium: {
  sip: {
    outgoing: {
      to: "sip:<destination>@<sip_domain>",
      from: "<your_identifier>",
      username: "<authentication_username>",
      password: "<authentication_password>"
    }
  }
}
```

When you create the call, Ultravox will automatically send a SIP invite using the properties provided.

### Outgoing SIP Parameters
<ParamField body="to" type="string" required>
  The target SIP URL to which the Ultravox call will connect.

  Examples:
  `sip:username@domain`, `sip:+15551234567@carrier.com`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="from" type="string" required>
  The caller identifier. Must conform to what your SIP trunk allows.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="username" type="string">
  Optional. Username for connecting to your SIP trunk.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="password" type="string">
  Optional. Password for connecting to your SIP trunk.
</ParamField>

### Examples

```js Example: Creating an Outgoing SIP Call to Linphone
    medium: {
      sip: {
        outgoing: {
          to: "sip:<username>@sip.linphone.org",
          from: "<company_name>"
        }
      }
    }
```

```js Example: Creating an Outgoing SIP Call using a Twilio trunk
    medium: {
      sip: {
        outgoing: {
          to: "+15551234567@trunkname.pstn.twilio.com",
          from: "+15557654321",  // Some phone number you've purchased from Twilio
          username: "authorized_user",  // A user you've created in Twilio allowed to use this number
          password: "password_for_authorized_user"
        }
      }
    }
```

## Supported Codecs

Ultravox Realtime supports wideband (AKA "HD audio") and narrowband SIP via various codecs:

| Codec | Audio Quality |
|-------|---------------|
| G.722 | HD (16kHz) |
| G.722.1 | HD (16kHz) |
| G.722.2 | HD (16kHz) |
| Opus | Premium HD (48kHz) |
| G.711 (PCMU/u-law) | Standard (8kHz) |
| G.711 (PCMA/a-law) | Standard (8kHz) |
| iLBC | Standard (8kHz) |

Using any other codec will cause calls to fail.

## Logs
Once a call has ended, you can see SIP logs for the call using the [sip logs](/api-reference/calls/calls-sip-logs-get) endpoint.
