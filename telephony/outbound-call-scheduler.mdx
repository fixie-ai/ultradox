  <b>Premium Feature</b>
  <br />
  Outbound Call Scheduler is available on select plans.
  
  See https://ultravox.ai/pricing for details.
</Callout>

The Outbound Call Scheduler (OCS) enables you to create and manage batches of outbound calls that will be sent by Ultravox. This allows you to simplify your deployment and stop worrying about things like retry logic. Simply define a time window and upload your call list - Ultravox handles the rest.

## Overview

The OCS eliminates the complexity of managing outbound call campaigns by:

- **Automatic Concurrency Management** - No more 429 errors from hitting rate limits
- **Flexible Scheduling** - Define time windows for when calls should be made
- **Automatic capacity reservation** - Save room for high priority or incoming calls while your campaign is running
- **Batch Management** - Track progress and control execution

<Danger>
  <b>Call Delivery Not Guaranteed</b>
  <br />
  Unless your call batch is scheduled without an end date/time, using OCS does not guarantee that all calls will be made. If capacity limitations result in calls not being made by the end of your window, those scheduled calls will have the `EXPIRED` status.
</Danger>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Scheduled Batch">
    Pick an agent and upload a batch of calls with a time window and configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Processing">
    Ultravox processes calls within your specified window, maximizing allowed utilization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Execution">
    Calls are either initiated automatically or via webhook notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Track batch status and individual call outcomes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Scheduled Batch

Use the [Create Scheduled Batch](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-post) API to upload your call batch:

```js Example: Creating a Scheduled Batch
{
  "windowStart": "2025-09-25T09:00:00Z",
  "windowEnd": "2025-09-25T17:00:00Z",
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-server.com/call-webhook",
  "webhookSecret": "your-secret-key",
  "calls": [
    {
      "medium": {
        "sip": {
          "outgoing": {
            "to": "sip:+15551234567@carrier.com",
            "from": "Your Company"
          }
        }
      },
      "templateContext": {
        "customerName": "John Doe",
        "appointmentTime": "3 PM tomorrow"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "customer_id": "12345",
        "campaign": "appointment_reminders"
      }
    },
    {
      "medium": {
        "twilio": {}
      },
      "templateContext": {
        "customerName": "Jane Smith", 
        "appointmentTime": "2 PM tomorrow"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "customer_id": "67890",
        "campaign": "appointment_reminders"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Batch Parameters

<ParamField body="windowStart" type="string" format="date-time">
  The earliest time when calls in this batch can be initiated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="windowEnd" type="string" format="date-time">
  The latest time when calls in this batch can be initiated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhookUrl" type="string" format="uri">
  Optional. URL to notify when calls are ready to be initiated. Required if any call doesn't have an outgoing medium.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhookSecret" type="string">
  Optional. Secret for webhook request verification. Auto-generated if not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="calls" type="array" required>
  Array of call configurations. Each call can include:
  - `medium` - Call medium (SIP, Twilio, etc.)
  - `templateContext` - Variables for agent template substitution
  - `metadata` - Key-value pairs associated with the call
  - `experimentalSettings` - Advanced call configuration
</ParamField>

## Call Execution Methods

The OCS supports two execution methods:

### Method 1: Automatic Execution
When all calls in your batch have an `outgoing` `sip` medium, Ultravox initiates calls automatically:

```js Automatic Execution Example
{
  "calls": [
    {
      "medium": {
        "sip": {
          "outgoing": {
            "to": "sip:+15551234567@carrier.com",
            "from": "Your Company"
          }
        }
      },
      "templateContext": { "customerName": "John" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Method 2: Webhook Notifications
When calls don't have outgoing mediums or you want more control, Ultravox notifies your webhook when capacity is available:

```js Webhook Method Example
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-server.com/call-ready",
  "calls": [
    {
      "templateContext": { "customerName": "John" },
      "metadata": { "phone": "+15551234567" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Your webhook receives notifications like:
```js Webhook Payload
{
  "batchId": "uuid",
  "callId": "uuid", 
  "templateContext": { "customerName": "John" },
  "metadata": { "phone": "+15551234567" }
}
```

## Managing Batches

### Monitor Batch Progress
Use [Get Scheduled Batch](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-get) to check status:

```js Response Example
{
  "batchId": "uuid",
  "totalCount": 1000,
  "completedCount": 750,
  "windowStart": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "windowEnd": "2024-01-15T17:00:00Z",
  "paused": false,
  "endedAt": null
}
```

### List Scheduled Calls
View individual calls with [List Scheduled Calls](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-scheduled-calls-list):

```bash
GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/scheduled_batches/{batch_id}/scheduled_calls?status=SUCCESS
```

### List Created Calls  
See completed calls with [List Created Calls](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-created-calls-list):

```bash
GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/scheduled_batches/{batch_id}/created_calls
```

### Pause a Batch
Use [Update Scheduled Batch](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-patch) to pause execution:

```js Pause Batch
{
  "paused": true
}
```

<Warning>
  <b>No Resume Function</b>
  <br />
  Once paused, batches cannot currently be resumed. Pausing effectively stops processing without deleting the batch.
</Warning>

### Delete a Batch
Use [Delete Scheduled Batch](/api-reference/agents/agents-scheduled-batches-delete) to remove a batch entirely.

## Limits and Considerations

### Request Limits
- **Call Count**: No specific limit on number of calls per batch
- **Request Size**: Maximum 32MB per batch request
- **Multiple Batches**: Create additional batches if your request size is > 32MB

### Time Windows
- Calls will only be processed during the specified window
- Use appropriate time zones in your ISO 8601 timestamps
- Consider business hours and time zones of your recipients

### Error Handling
- Monitor batch progress to identify systematic issues
- Completed calls have a status and will indicate any calls experiencing errors
