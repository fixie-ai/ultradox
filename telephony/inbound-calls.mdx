Ultravox can power AI agents that automatically answer incoming phone calls from your users. This is perfect for customer service, support lines, or any application where users initiate contact.

## How Inbound Calls Work
The simplest way to set up inbound calls is to [import your credentials](/telephony/supported-providers#providing-telephony-credentials) and point your telephony provider directly to Ultravox.

Alternatively, you can use these steps when routing calls through your own application.
<Steps>
  <Step title="User Dials You">
    User dials your phone number purchased from your telephony provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incoming Webhook">
    Provider routes the call to your configured webhook/application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Ultravox Call">
    Your server creates an Ultravox call and gets a `joinUrl`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect & Answer">
    Connect the call to your provider using the `joinUrl`. The AI agent answers and begins the conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Template Variables
When you use [Agents](/agents/overview#why-start-with-agents%3F) for creating calls, you can define template variables that get passed in at call creation time.

When using simplified incoming call handling, you can define a mapping from your provider's requests to template context fields. For example, for Twilio you could add an entry like `{"From": "user.phone_number"}` to add `{"user": {"phone_number": "+15551234567"}}` to the template context .

When handling telephony webhooks yourself, this data might come from an IVR or your own application. You then specify it as normal when creating your Ultravox call, e.g.

```js Example: Template Context
// System prompt expects template variables
systemPrompt: "You are calling {{customerName}}..."

// Set templateContext at call creation time
templateContext: {
  customerName: "VIP Customer",
  accountType: "enterprise"
}
```
