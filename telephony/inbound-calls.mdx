Ultravox can power AI agents that automatically answer incoming phone calls from your users. This is perfect for customer service, support lines, or any application where users initiate contact.

## How Inbound Calls Work
<Steps>
  <Step title="User Dials You">
    User dials your phone number purchased from your telephony provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incoming Webhook">
    Provider routes the call to your configured webhook/application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Ultravox Call">
    Your server creates an Ultravox call and gets a `joinUrl`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect & Answer">
    Connect the call to your provider using the `joinUrl`. The AI agent answers and begins the conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Template Variables
When you use [Agents](/agents/overview#why-start-with-agents%3F) for creating calls, you can define template variables that get passed in a call creation time. For incoming calls, this data might come from an IVR or your own application.

```js Example: Template Context
// System prompt expects template variables
systemPrompt: "You are calling {{customerName}}..."

// Set templateContext at call creation time
templateContext: {
  customerName: "VIP Customer",
  accountType: "enterprise"
}
```
