## Active Deprecations

### Currently Scheduled Changes

| Feature/API | Status       | Deprecation Date | Removal Date | Migration Guidance               |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |----------------------------------|
| `initiator` | ⚠️ < 30 days  | 2024-10-01       | 2024-12-31   | [Guide](/changelog/migration/firstspeaker) |

## Deprecation Process
We recognize that breaking changes and deprecation notices are not fun and we try to avoid them when possible.

However, the Ultravox APIs have not yet reached v1 and we are committed to having our APIs and SDKs work better and be as clear as possible. This means we will inevitably need to revisit some choices early on.

This process will evolve as the APIs mature. Please share your feedback with us if you'd like to see any changes to the process or policy.
