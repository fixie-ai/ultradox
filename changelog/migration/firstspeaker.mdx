`initiator` is being removed as an option when [creating a call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post).

It has been replaced with `firstSpeaker`.

## Why Change?
`initiator` was confusing as it was used to indicate who was responsible for starting the call (`INITIATOR_USER` or `INITIATOR_AGENT`). It was set to agent for any outbound calls or left as the default (user) for in-bound calls.

`firstSpeaker` more clearly indicates who speaks first during the call. For inbound calls, the default (`FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT`) will have the agent answer the call. For outbound calls, setting it to `FIRST_SPEAKER_USER` indicates the expectation that most people answer a phone call with "Hello?".

## How to Migrate
* If you previously set `initiator` to `INITIATOR_AGENT`, set `firstSpeaker` to `FIRST_SPEAKER_USER` instead to maintain the same behavior.
* If you previously set `initiator` to `INITIATOR_USER`, set `firstSpeaker` to `FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT` instead to maintain the same behavior.
* If you weren't setting `initiator`, you can continue not setting `firstSpeaker`.

Note: If you use `FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT` for outbound calls, the first part of the agent's utterance might be clipped due to delays in the phone network.
