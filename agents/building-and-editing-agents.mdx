## Planning Your Agent

Before creating an agent, consider these key design decisions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Purpose & Personality">
    What is your agent's role? Customer support, sales assistant, information provider? Define the personality, tone, and expertise level.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Required Capabilities">
    What tools and integrations does your agent need? Knowledge base access, CRM integration, payment processing?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Dynamic Content">
    What information changes between calls? Customer names, account details, product catalogs? These become template variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Voice & Language">
    Select appropriate voice characteristics and language settings for your target audience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The web app and API are fully compatible. Agents created in either can be managed through both interfaces.

### Using the No-Code Web App
For teams preferring visual interfaces, Ultravox provides a [web-based agent builder](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents/new):

**When to Use the Web App:**
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Non-technical team members need to create agents
- Visual configuration is preferred over code
- Quick testing of voice and personality combinations

**When to Use the API:**
- Production deployments, CI/CD integration, and version control
- Complex template variable schemas
- Advanced tool configurations

**Transitioning Between Approaches:**
- Start with the web app for rapid prototyping
- Export configurations to API calls for production
- Use the web app for quick edits, API for deployment

### Using the API

Create agents programmatically for full control and integration with your development workflow:

```js Example: Creating a New Customer Support Agent
// Note: we are using a template variable for customerName
const createAgent = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.ultravox.ai/api/agents', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Customer Support Agent',
      callTemplate: {
        systemPrompt: "You are Anna, a friendly customer support agent for Acme Inc. You are talking to {{customerName}}. You should help them with their questions about our products and services. If you can't answer a question, offer to connect them with a human support agent.",
        voice: "Jessica",
        temperature: 0.4,
        recordingEnabled: true,
        firstSpeakerSettings: {
          agent: {
            text: "Hello! This is Anna from Acme customer support. How can I help you today?"
          }
        },
        selectedTools: [
          { toolName: 'knowledgebaseLookup' },
          { toolName: 'orderStatus' },
          { toolName: 'transferToHuman' }
        ]
      }
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

## Call Template Configuration

The call template is the heart of your agent, defining all behavior and capabilities:

### System Prompt

Design effective system prompts that define your agent's personality and knowledge. Here's an example prompt using various template variables that will be populated at call creation time using the [templateContext](/api-reference/agents/agents-calls-post#body-template-context) property:

```text Example: Defining an Agent System Prompt
You are {{agentName}}, a {{role}} for {{companyName}}. 

Your personality: {{personality}}
Your expertise: {{expertise}}

Guidelines:
- Always be {{tone}} and professional
- If you don't know something, offer to transfer the call to a human agent using the 'transferToHuman' tool
- Keep responses concise but helpful
- Reference the customer as {{customerName}} when appropriate

Context about this conversation:
- Customer type: {{customerTier}}
- Previous interaction: {{lastInteraction}}
```

For more, see our [Prompting Guide →](/gettingstarted/prompting)

### Voice Configuration

Choose a voice that matches your brand and audience. 

```js Example: Built-in vs. External Voice
// Built-in Ultravox voice
voice: "Jessica"  // Professional, friendly

// External voice providers (requires API keys)
externalVoice: {
  elevenLabs: {
    voiceId: "your-elevenlabs-voice-id",
    model: "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
    speed: 1.0,
    stability: 0.8
  }
}
```

Learn more in the [Voices Overview →](/voices/overview)



### Tool Selection and Configuration

Connect your agent to external capabilities using tools:

```js Example: Defining Selected Tools
selectedTools: [
  {
    toolName: 'knowledgebaseLookup',
    descriptionOverride: 'Search our product documentation and FAQ',
    parameterOverrides: {
      maxResults: 3
    }
  },
  {
    toolName: 'orderStatus',
    authTokens: {
      apiKey: 'your-order-system-key'
    }
  },
  {
    toolName: 'transferToHuman'
  }
]
```

## Agent Management

### Updating Agents

You can update the agent via the [Ultravox web app](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents) or via the [Update Agent](/api-reference/agents/agents-patch) API.

```js Example: Updating Agent via API
const updateAgent = async (agentId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ultravox.ai/api/agents/${agentId}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      callTemplate: {
        systemPrompt: "Updated system prompt...",
        temperature: 0.4  // Only fields you want to change
      }
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

<Warning>
  Agent changes only affect new calls. Active calls continue using the configuration they started with.
</Warning>

### Monitoring and Analytics

Track agent performance and usage:

```js Example: Getting Agent Stats & Calls
// Get agent statistics
const getAgentStats = async (agentId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ultravox.ai/api/agents/${agentId}`, {
    headers: { 'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key' }
  });
  
  const agent = await response.json();
  console.log('Total calls:', agent.statistics.calls);
};

// Get recent calls for this agent
const getAgentCalls = async (agentId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.ultravox.ai/api/agents/${agentId}/calls`, {
    headers: { 'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key' }
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
```

## When to Use Advanced Features

**Start Simple:** Begin with mono prompts that handle your core use case in a single system prompt. This approach works well for:
- Straightforward customer support
- Information lookup
- Basic transaction flows

**Add Complexity When Needed:** If mono prompting isn't sufficient for your use case, gradually add:
- **Inline instructions** for multi-step processes → [Guiding Agents](/agents/guiding-agents)
- **Call stages** for completely different conversation phases → [Call Stages](/agents/call-stages)

**Don't Over-Engineer:** Resist the temptation to add complexity early. Most voice applications can be built successfully with simple agent configurations.
