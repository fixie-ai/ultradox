## Types of Tools

### Built-in Tools
Ultravox provides several ready-to-use tools for common functionality:
- **queryCorpus**: Retrieve information from knowledge bases.
- **playDtmfSounds**: Play dial tones for telephony applications.
- **leaveVoicemail**: Leaves voicemail message and ends the call.
- **hangUp**: End calls programmatically.

### Custom Tools
Create your own tools to integrate with any external system or API. Custom tools can:
- Send emails or notifications
- Look up customer information
- Process payments
- Update databases
- Integrate with third-party services

## Tool Implementation Types

**HTTP Tools**: Most common type - your tool runs on your server and Ultravox calls it via HTTP.

**Client Tools**: Run directly in the client application using our SDKs.

## Tool Persistence

**Durable Tools**: Created once via API or the web app, reused across calls and agents. Best for production.

**Temporary Tools**: Defined per-call, great for testing and rapid iteration.
