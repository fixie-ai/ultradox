You can use files as sources for any of your corpora.

Files can be added via the [Web App](https://app.ultravox.ai/rag) or via the [Create Corpus File Upload API](/api-reference/corpora/corpora-uploads-post).

## Upload Files via Web App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Source">
    * Go to [RAG](https://app.ultravox.ai/rag) in the Ultravox web application.
    * Click `New Source` in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Details and Files">
    * Select the `Collection` to which you want to add the content.
    * (Optionally) Add a `Name` and `Description` for the new source.
    * Select `Document` and add files.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    * Click `Save` and wait a few moments for your content to be uploaded and ingested.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload Files via API
To upload files using the API, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Request Upload URL">
    * Use the [Create Corpus File Upload API](/api-reference/corpora/corpora-uploads-post)
    * Include the MIME type string in the request body
    * This returns the URL to use for upload and the unique ID for the document
    * URLs expire after 5 minutes. Request a new one if it expires before using it

    <Note>The URL that is returned is tied to the provided MIME type. The same MIME type must be used during upload.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Upload File">
    * Use the `presignedUrl` from Step 1 to upload the document
    * Ensure the MIME type in the upload matches what was specified in Step 1

    For example, if we requested an upload URL for a text file (MIME type `text/plain`):

    ```bash
    FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/file"
    UPLOAD_URL="https://storage.googleapis.com/fixie-ultravox-prod/..."

    curl -X PUT \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
      --data-binary @"$FILE_PATH" \
      "$UPLOAD_URL"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Create New Source with Uploaded Document">
    * Use the [Create Corpus Source API](/api-reference/corpora/corpora-sources-post)
    * Use `upload` to provide the `documentId` from Step 1

    <Note>You can provide an array of Document IDs to bulk create a source.</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
