---
This tutorial walks you through building a node.js application that allows the Ultravox AI agent to transfer an incoming phone call to a human agent. The system will:
1. Recognize when a customer needs a human to intervene
2. Connect the customer to a human agent

**What you'll learn:**
- How to handle an inbound call using jambonz
- How to connect an inbound call to an Ultravox AI agent
- How to transfer an ongoing call from an AI agent to a human agent


## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- a [jambonz](https://jambonz.cloud/) account
- an [Ultravox](https://ultravox.ai/) account
- Node.js 16+ installed on your machine
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) installed on your machine

## jambonz

jambonz is a “bring your own everything” open-source telephony platform that integrates Ultravox directly via their [llm](https://docs.jambonz.org/verbs/verbs/llm) verb.
This gives you the flexibility to use your carrier and speech provider of choice, you'll just need to add them in your jambonz dashboard, following the steps below.

### Implementation Steps

{/* - ngrok
- jambonz setup + carrier, phone number
- implement the transfer logic - llm verb
- customize prompt + further parameters
- .env
- test */}

<Tip>
  <b>Stuck?</b>
  <br />
  If at any point you get lost, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/jambonz/ultravox-transfer-call-example).
</Tip>

<Tip>
  <b>Debugging</b>
  <br />
  During testing, watch your terminal for ngrok request logs to verify the endpoint is being called correctly.
  Keep an eye on Recent Calls and Alerts in your jambonz dashboard.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up ngrok

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use ngrok to expose our local server to the internet. This allows jambonz to send requests to our local server without needing to deploy it to a public server.

1. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

2. Make note of the ngrok URL (it will look like `https://1234-56-78-910-11.ngrok-free.app`), we'll use it in the next step.

## Step 2: jambonz Portal Setup

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Your Carrier in jambonz">
        In jambonz, we use the terms “carrier” and “SIP trunk” interchangeably. jambonz is a “Bring your own carrier” platform, which means that you can connect any SIP network provider or device. [Add your carrier of choice](https://docs.jambonz.org/guides/using-the-jambonz-portal/basic-concepts/creating-carriers) in your jambonz dashboard to get started. 
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add a Speech Provider in jambonz">
        Next, you need to [add speech credentials](https://docs.jambonz.org/guides/using-the-jambonz-portal/basic-concepts/creating-speech-credentials) for your chosen vendor.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a New jambonz Application">
        In jambonz, an application defines how calls are handled by liniking them to our custom logic through webhooks or WebSocket endpoints. We're building a WebSocket application, so we need to link the transfer-call WebSocket endpoint.

        When creating an application, you specify:
        - Call webhook URL: Where jambonz sends call events.​ — use the ngrok URL you copied earlier as `wss://your-ngrok-url-here/transfer-call`
        - Call status webhook URL: For receiving call status updates.​ — use the ngrok URL you copied earlier as `wss://your-ngrok-url-here/transfer-call`
        - Speech vendors: Your chosen TTS/STT providers.​ — select the speech provider you just created

        We're building a WebSocket application, so both the call webhook and call status webhook will be the WebSocket endpoint.

        Once saved, you can associate phone numbers or SIP trunks with this application, ensuring that incoming calls are routed to your specified logic. 
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add a Phone Number in jambonz">
        Finally, you need to [add a phone number](https://docs.jambonz.org/guides/using-the-jambonz-portal/basic-concepts/creating-phone-numbers) provisioned from your carrier of choice. At the bottom of the page select the jambonz application you just created to link your new virtual number to that application.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

## Step 3: Implement WebSocket Endpoint
Now that we have our jambonz application set up, we need to implement the WebSocket endpoint that will handle incoming calls. This endpoint will be responsible for controlling the call flow, connecting the caller to an Ultravox agent, and transferring them to a human agent when necessary.
To do this, we will use the [`@jambonz/node-client-ws`](https://docs.jambonz.org/sdks/nodeclientws) client SDK to create a WebSocket server that listens for incoming calls and handles them according to the logic we implement.

### The jambonz WebSocket Client SDK

jambonz can interact with applications using either HTTP webhooks or a websocket connection. This library alows jambonz to interact with applications via a websocket connection. This is useful for applications that need to maintain a persistent connection to jambonz, such as those that require real-time updates or bidirectional communication.

To use this library, an application must first create an http(s) server. This library exposes a function, `createEndpoint` that is then invoked to attach a websocket server to that http server.

Doing so exposes a `makeService` function that can then be called one or more times to create different services corresponding to different request paths ( ‘/transfer-call’ in our case).

Calling `makeService` with a path returns a service client associated with that path. The client emits a `session:new` event when an incoming call has been received for the specified path, providing the application with a `session` object which is then used to act on that call. We'll attach [verbs](https://docs.jambonz.org/verbs/verbs/overview) to this object to define the call flow.



```js
// index.js
require('dotenv').config(); // load environment variables from .env file
const logger = require('pino')({level: process.env.LOGLEVEL || 'info'}); // create a logger instance


/* create an http/s server in your application */
const {createServer} = require('http');
const server = createServer();
const port = process.env.WS_PORT || 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
    logger.info(`jambonz websocket server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

/* require the library and call the returned function with your server */
const {createEndpoint} = require('@jambonz/node-client-ws');
const makeService = createEndpoint({server});

const service = ({logger, makeService}) => {
    /* create a jambonz application listeng for requests with URL path '/transfer-call' */
    const svc = makeService({path: '/transfer-call'});

    /* listen for new calls to that service */
    svc.on('session:new', (session) => {
      /* the 'session' object has all of the properties of the incoming call */
      session.locals = {logger: logger.child({call_sid: session.call_sid})};
      logger.info({session}, `new incoming call: ${session.call_sid}`);
      // this is where we'll handle an incoming call

      try {
            /* set up some event handlers for this session */
            session
                .on('close', onClose.bind(null, session))
                .on('error', onError.bind(null, session))

            /* all of the jambonz verbs are available as methods on the session object 
            https://www.jambonz.org/docs/webhooks/overview/ */
            session
                .answer()
                .pause({length: 1.5})
                .llm({
                  // jambonz integrates with Ultravox via the llm verb
                  // this is where we'll connect the call to the Ultravox agent
                })
                .hangup()
                .send(); // sends the queued verbs to jambonz

        } catch (err) {
          session.locals.logger.info({err}, `Error to responding to incoming call: ${session.call_sid}`);
          session.close();
        }

    });
};

const onClose = (session, code, reason) => {
    const {logger} = session.locals;
    logger.info({session, code, reason}, `session ${session.call_sid} closed`);
};

const onError = (session, err) => {
    const {logger} = session.locals;
    logger.info({err}, `session ${session.call_sid} received error`);
};

module.exports = service;
service({logger, makeService});  

```


## Step 4: 











## Testing Your Implementation


## Common Issues

1. **ngrok URL Not Working**
   - Make sure ngrok is running
   - Check the URL is correctly copied to `demo-config.ts`
   - Verify no trailing slash in the URL

2. **...**
