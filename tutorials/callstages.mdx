Learn how to implement customer service escalation in Ultravox using call stages to handle customer complaints by transferring them to a manager.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to implement an escalation tool
- How to use call stages to switch conversation context
- How to handle manager takeover with a new system prompt
- Testing escalation scenarios

**Time to complete:** 25 minutes

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React
- The starter code from our [tutorial repository](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox-tutorial-call-stages)
- Node.js 16+ installed on your machine
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) installed on your machine

## Understanding Call Stages

Call stages in Ultravox enable dynamic changes to an ongoing conversation by:
- Switching system prompts mid-conversation
- Changing voice personalities
- Maintaining conversation context
- Handling role transitions seamlessly

In this tutorial, we'll use call stages to transfer angry customers to a manager who can better handle their complaints.

## Project Overview: Dr. Donut Manager Escalation

We'll build an escalation system for our Dr. Donut drive-thru that allows the AI agent to transfer difficult situations to a manager. The system will:
1. Recognize when a customer needs manager assistance
2. Collect complaint details
3. Switch to a manager persona with authority to resolve issues

### Implementation Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up ngrok">
    Enable external access to our escalation endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Tool">
    Create a schema for escalation requests
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Manager Handler">
    Build the API route for manager takeover
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update System Prompt">
    Add escalation rules to the base prompt
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the System">
    Verify escalation flows
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  <b>Stuck?</b>
  <br />
  If at any point you get lost, you can refer to the [`/final`](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox-tutorial-call-stages/tree/main/final) folder in the repo to get final versions of the various files you will create or edit.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  <b>Debugging</b>
  <br />
  During testing, watch your terminal for ngrok request logs to verify the escalation endpoint is being called correctly.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Set Up ngrok

First, we need to make our escalation endpoint accessible to Ultravox.

1. Start your development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

2. In a new terminal, start ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Copy the HTTPS URL from ngrok (it will look like `https://1234-56-78-910-11.ngrok-free.app`)
   
4. Update `toolsBaseUrl` in `demo-config.ts`:
```ts
const toolsBaseUrl = 'https://your-ngrok-url-here';
```

## Step 2: Define the Escalation Tool

We'll define an `escalateToManager` tool that the AI agent will use to transfer difficult customers.

Update the `selectedTools` array in `demo-config.ts` and add to our call definition:

```ts
const selectedTools: SelectedTool[] = [
  {
    "temporaryTool": {
      "modelToolName": "escalateToManager",
      "description": "Escalate to the manager in charge. Use this tool if a customer becomes irate, asks for a refund, or complains about the food.",
      "dynamicParameters": [
        {
          "name": "complaintDetails",
          "location": ParameterLocation.BODY,
          "schema": {
            "description": "An object containing details about the nature of the complaint or issue.",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "complaintType": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["refund", "food", "price", "other"],
                "description": "The type of complaint."
              },
              "complaintDetails": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The details of the complaint."
              },
              "desiredResolution": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The resolution the customer is seeking."
              },
              "firstName": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Customer first name."
              },
              "lastName": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Customer last name."
              }
            },
            "required": ["complaintType", "complaintDetails"]
          },
          "required": true
        }
      ],
      "http": {
        "baseUrlPattern": `${toolsBaseUrl}/api/managerEscalation`,
        "httpMethod": "POST"
      }
    }
  }
];

// Update call definition to add selectedTools
export const demoConfig: DemoConfig = {
  title: "Dr. Donut",
  overview: "This agent has been prompted to facilitate orders at a fictional drive-thru called Dr. Donut.",
  callConfig: {
    systemPrompt: getSystemPrompt(),
    model: "fixie-ai/ultravox-70B",
    languageHint: "en",
    voice: "Mark",
    temperature: 0.4,
    selectedTools: selectedTools
  }
};
```

## Step 3: Create Manager Handler

Create a new file at `app/api/managerEscalation/route.ts` to handle the escalation:

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const managerPrompt: string = `
  # Drive-Thru Order System Configuration

  ## Agent Role
  - Name: Dr. Donut Drive-Thru Manager
  - Context: Voice-based order taking system with TTS output
  - Current time: ${new Date()}

  ## Menu Items
    [Menu items section - same as base prompt]

  ## Conversation Flow
  1. Greeting -> Apologize for Situation -> Offer Resolution -> Order Confirmation -> End

  ## Response Guidelines
  1. Voice-Optimized Format
    - Use spoken numbers ("one twenty-nine" vs "$1.29")
    - Avoid special characters and formatting
    - Use natural speech patterns

  2. Conversation Management
    - Keep responses brief (1-2 sentences)
    - Use clarifying questions for ambiguity
    - Maintain conversation flow without explicit endings
    - Allow for casual conversation

  3. Greeting
    - Tell the customer that you are the manager
    - Inform the customer you were just informed of the issue
    - Then move to the apology

  4. Apology
    - Acknowledge customer concern
    - Apologize and reaffirm Dr. Donut's commitment to quality and customer happiness

  5. Resolving Customer Concern
    - Offer reasonable remedy
    - Maximum refund amount equal to purchase amount
    - Offer $10 or $20 gift cards for more extreme issues

  [Rest of guidelines section]
`;

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  console.log(`Got escalation!`);

  // Set-up escalation
  const responseBody = {
    systemPrompt: managerPrompt,
    voice: 'Jessica'  // Different voice for manager
  };
  const response = NextResponse.json(responseBody);
  // Set our custom header for starting a new call stage
  response.headers.set('X-Ultravox-Response-Type', 'new-stage');

  return response;
}
```

## Step 4: Update System Prompt

Add escalation rules to your base system prompt in `demo-config.ts`:

```ts
## Response Guidelines
  [Previous guidelines...]

  6. Angry Customers or Complaints
    - You must escalate to your manager for angry customers, refunds, or big problems
    - Before you escalate, ask the customer if they would like to talk to your manager
    - If the customer wants the manager, you MUST call the tool "escalateToManager"

  ## State Management
    [Previous instructions...]
  - Use the "escalateToManager" tool for any complaints or angry customers
```

## Testing Your Implementation

Here are three scenarios to test the escalation system:

### Scenario 1: Food Quality Issue
```
Customer: "I just found hair in my donuts! This is disgusting!"
Expected: Agent should offer manager assistance and escalate with complaint type "food"
```

### Scenario 2: Out of Stock Frustration
```
Customer: "You don't have the Magic Rainbow donuts in stock and this is the third time I drove down here this week for them! This is ridiculous!"
Expected: Agent should offer manager assistance and escalate with complaint type "other"
```

### Scenario 3: Product and Refund
```
Customer: "This coffee is cold and I want a refund right now!"
Expected: Agent should offer manager assistance and escalate with complaint type "refund"
```

For each scenario, verify:
1. The agent offers manager assistance
2. The escalation tool is called with appropriate details
3. The manager persona takes over with the new voice
4. The manager follows the resolution guidelines

## Common Issues

1. **ngrok URL Not Working**
   - Make sure ngrok is running
   - Check the URL is correctly copied to `demo-config.ts`
   - Verify no trailing slash in the URL

2. **Escalation Not Triggering**
   - Check the system prompt includes escalation guidelines
   - Verify the complaint is clearly expressed
   - Try using keywords like "manager", "refund", or "complaint"

3. **Manager Voice Not Changing**
   - Verify the `X-Ultravox-Response-Type` header is set
   - Check the voice parameter in the response body

## Next Steps

Now that you've implemented basic escalation, you can:
- Implement different manager personalities for different situations
- Create a complaint logging system
- Add resolution tracking and follow-up mechanisms
