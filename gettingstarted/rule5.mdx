## The fifth rule of building with Ultravox: "The Start Call 2-Step".
Calls are the core of Ultravox. A call is an interaction between an agent and an end user.

Calls have two distinct steps:

**Call Creation** → Calls are configured and created using the Ultravox REST API's [/calls](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoint. Creating a call returns a `joinUrl` which is then used to join the call.

**Join Call** → Once created, calls are joined (and ended) using our [client SDK](/sdk-reference/), bridged to from a [telephony provider](/essentials/telephony), or connected from your server via [WebSockets](/guides/websockets).
