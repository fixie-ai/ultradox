## Using the Built-in `hangUp` Tool
<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with the Ultravox Console">
    Go to [Agents](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents).
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/screenshots/quickstart-agent-light.png" />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/screenshots/quickstart-agent-dark.png" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Agent">
    Click on `New Agent` in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a Name and Prompt">
    Copy & paste the following for the name of your agent:

    ```text
    Tools_Agent
    ```

    Next, copy and paste this system prompt:

    ```text
    If the user says "Oklahoma" you must immediately call the 'hangUp' tool.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the hangUp Tool">
    Use the `Tools` drop-down and select the `hangUp` tool.

    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/screenshots/quickstart-tools-add-dark.png" />
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Test the Agent">
    * Save the agent using the `Save` button. This agent will be used in part two of this quickstart.

    * Start a call with your agent by clicking the `Test Agent` button on the bottom right.

    * When you say the word "Oklahoma", the agent will call the tool and the call will end and you will see the call state change to `DISCONNECTED`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Custom Tool
<Info>
  This part uses the `Tools_Agent` we created above in [Using Built-in Tools](#using-built-in-tools).
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the getAdvice Tool">
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/screenshots/quickstart-tools-custom-light.png" />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/screenshots/quickstart-tools-custom-dark.png" />

    Under `Tools` click on [New Tool](https://app.ultravox.ai/tools/new). Set properties as follows and then click on `Save`:

    **Tool Name:**
    ```text
    getAdvice
    ```

    **Description:**
    ```text
    This tool provides random advice.
    ```

    **Custom Endpoint URL:**
    ```text
    api.adviceslip.com/advice
    ```

    <Note>We are using the public adviceslip API as a quick example.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Tools_Agent">
    * Go to [Agents](https://app.ultravox.ai/agents)
    * Click `...` on the right side of our `Tools_Agent`
    * Choose `Edit`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the getAdvice Tool">
    Use the `Tools` drop-down and select the `getAdvice` tool. You can keep the `hangUp` tool selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Prompt">
    Copy & paste the following for the system prompt:

    ```text
    You are the world's best companion. You love talking to people.
    
    If someone asks for or needs advice, you must use the 'getAdvice' tool. 
    When you receive advice from the tool call, relay it back to the user.

    If the user says "Oklahoma" you must immediately call the 'hangUp' tool.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Test the Agent">
    * Save the agent using the `Save` button.

    * Start a call with your agent by clicking the `Test Agent` button on the bottom right.

    * If you ask for advice, the agent will now use the tool to get random advice from the adviceslip API.

    * Saying "Oklahoma" will continue to trigger the hangUp tool.
  </Step>
