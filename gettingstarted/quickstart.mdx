Get your first AI voice agent up and running in just a few minutes. This quickstart will walk you through making an automated phone call using Ultravox and Twilio.

<Note>
<b>Don't use Twilio?</b>

Ultravox Realtime enables you connect your voice AI agents via [telephony providers](/telephony/overview), [Websockets](/apps/websockets), [SIP trunks](/telephony/sip), or in [web/native apps](/apps/overview).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ultravox account">[Sign up here](https://app.ultravox.ai) if you haven't already</Step>
  <Step title="API key">Create one in the [Ultravox console](https://app.ultravox.ai/settings/)</Step>
  <Step title="Twilio account">with Account SID, Auth Token, and a phone number</Step>
  <Step title="Node.js 20">or higher installed</Step>
</Steps>

## Make Your First Outbound Call

Here's the core concept in 3 steps:

### 1. Create an Ultravox Call
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_ULTRAVOX_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    systemPrompt: "You are Steve, a friendly AI assistant calling to check in.",
    medium: { "twilio": {} },
    firstSpeakerSettings: { user: {} }
  })
});

const { joinUrl } = await response.json();
```

### 2. Make the Phone Call
```javascript
const call = await twilioClient.calls.create({
  twiml: `<Response><Connect><Stream url="${joinUrl}"/></Connect></Response>`,
  to: '+1234567890',
  from: 'YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER'
});
```

### 3. Your AI Agent Talks!
When the recipient answers, your AI agent starts the conversation.

## How It Works

This quickstart example:

1. **Creates an Ultravox call** configured for outbound phone calls
2. **Uses Twilio** to initiate the phone call to your target number
3. **Connects the call** to your AI agent using Ultravox's streaming API
4. **Starts the conversation** when the recipient answers

The AI agent follows the system prompt you provide and can have natural voice conversations with the person who answers.
