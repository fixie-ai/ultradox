The Ultravox API allows you to create AI-powered voice applications that can interact through various protocols:

- **WebRTC** → Default protocol for browser and mobile applications.
- **Regular Phone Numbers** → Connect Ultravox to phone calls you make or receive (via Telnxy, Twilio, or Plivo).
- **WebSockets** → Direct server-to-server integration.

## Choosing a Protocol
Choose your integration method based on your needs:

- **WebRTC**: Best for most integrations, especially for any client deployment (for example, browsers or mobile clients). This is the default. Get started with the Ultravox client [SDK](/essentials/sdk).
- **Phone**: For traditional phone network integration. Ultravox integrates directly with Telnyx, Twilio, and Plivo.
- **WebSocket**: For server-to-server integration, especially when you already have high-bandwidth connections between your server and clients. Check out the [WebSocket Integration](/guides/websockets) guide for more information.

## Phone Integration
Ultravox integrates with multiple telephony providers, enabling you to create AI-powered voice applications that can interact through regular phone networks. You can build AI agents that can make outgoing calls and answer incoming calls, opening up possibilities for customer service, automated outreach, and other voice-based AI applications.

### Supported Providers
- **Twilio** → Uses Twilio [Media Streams](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/media-streams).
- **Telnyx** → Uses Telnyx [Media Streaming](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/programmable-voice/media-streaming).
- **Plivo** → Uses Plivo [AudioStream](https://www.plivo.com/docs/voice/xml/the-stream-element/).

### Prerequisites
<Tip>
<b>Prerequisites</b>
<br />
Make sure you have:
1. An active account with your chosen provider (Telnyx, Twilio, or Plivo)
2. A phone number purchased from your provider
</Tip>

### Connecting Ultravox to a Phone Call
<Warning>
<b>"Calls" is Overloaded</b>
<br />
It can be a bit confusing because Ultravox Realtime uses the concept of a "call" to mean a voice session between an AI agent and another party. For phone calls, you will accept incoming or make outgoing calls via your chosen telephony provider and then connect those calls to an Ultravox call.
</Warning>

Creating an Ultravox call that you can connect with a phone call is similar to creating a WebRTC call, but requires specific parameters in the [Create Call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) command:

<ParamField body="medium" type="object" default="{'webRtc': {}}">
  Tells Ultravox which protocol to use. For phone calls, must be set to one of:
  
  `{"telnyx": {}}`, `{"twilio": {}}`, or `{"plivo": {}}`.
  
  Defaults to `{"webRtc": {}}`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="firstSpeaker" type="string" default="FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT">
  Tells Ultravox who should speak first.
  
  For outgoing calls, typically set to `"FIRST_SPEAKER_USER"`.
  
  The default is `"FIRST_SPEAKER_AGENT"`.
</ParamField>

```js Example: Outgoing Call via Telnyx {4-7}
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
  ...
  "medium": {
    "telnyx": {} // or "twilio": {} or "plivo": {}
  },
  "firstSpeaker": "FIRST_SPEAKER_USER"
}
```

    #### Outgoing Calls with Plivo
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an Ultravox Call">
        Create a new call as shown above with `medium: { "plivo": {} }`, `firstSpeaker: "FIRST_SPEAKER_USER"`, and get a `joinUrl`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect Ultravox to the Plivo Phone Call">
        Use the `joinUrl` with AudioStream:

        ```javascript
        // Example using the plivo node library
        // This assumes our server exposes an endpoint at `answerUrl`
        const call = await plivo.calls.create({

          answer_url: answerUrl, // URL that returns the XML below
          answer_method: "GET"
        });
        ```

        The answer URL should return:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <Response>
            <Stream keepCallAlive="true"

            </Stream>
        </Response>
        ```

        Note: For best audio quality, we recommend `audio/x-l16;rate=16000`. However, any contentType supported by Plivo will work with Ultravox.

<b>Provider Support</b>
<br />
We currently integrate with Telnyx, Twilio, and Plivo. Please [let us know](https://discord.com/channels/1240071833798184990/1315065334058713198) if there's another integration you'd like to see.
</Note>

### DTMF
Ultravox provides comprehensive support for DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) tones, enabling both [sending](#sending-dtmf-tones) and [receiving](#receiving-dtmf-tones) tones during phone calls. This enables AI agents to interact with traditional phone systems and allows you to build voice applications that can respond to keypad inputs.

<Note>
<b>DTMF and WebRTC</b>
<br />
Due to the audio codec used in WebRTC connections, DTMF tones are inaudible when using WebRTC. The `playDtmfSounds` tool is intended for use with [telephony integrations](/essentials/telephony).
</Note>

#### Receiving DTMF Tones
Ultravox automatically converts incoming DTMF tones to text, making it easy to build interactive voice applications that respond to keypad input. When a caller presses keys on their phone keypad, the tones are converted to text that your AI agent can understand and respond to.

For example, if a caller presses "5" on their keypad, your agent will receive this as text and can respond accordingly:

```js
// Example system prompt for an agent that handles DTMF input
{
  "systemPrompt": `You are an automated phone system.
    When a caller joins, say: "Welcome! Press 1 for sales, 2 for support, or 3 for billing."
    If they press 1, transfer them to sales using the transfer tool.
    If they press 2, transfer them to support.
    If they press 3, transfer them to billing.
    If they press any other key, ask them to try again with a valid option."`
}
```

#### Sending DTMF Tones
The [built-in](/essentials/tools#built-in-tools) `playDtmfSounds` tool allows your AI agent to send DTMF tones, which is useful for navigating Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems or other phone trees. To enable the tool, add it to the `selectedTools` array when creating a call or call stage:

```js
// Example request body for creating a call with DTMF capability
{
  "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant. When prompted to dial an extension, use the 'playDtmfSounds' tool to send the appropriate tones.",
  "selectedTools": [
    { "toolName": "playDtmfSounds" }
  ]
}
```

The `playDtmfSounds` tool accepts a string parameter named `digits` and works with the following tones: 0-9, *, #, A-D.

For example:

```js
// Example of using the playDtmfSounds tool to dial an extension
{
  "digits": "123#"  // Will play tones for 1, 2, 3, and # in sequence
}
```

Note: the `playDtmfSounds` tool uses an [automatic parameter](/essentials/tools#automatic-parameters) that sends the proper sample rate of the source audio and should be treated as an implementation detail.

#### Common Use Cases
- Building interactive phone trees or IVR systems
- Creating agents that can navigate existing phone systems
- Enabling quick responses through keypad input
- Collecting numeric input (e.g., account numbers, PIN codes)
- Building hybrid voice/keypad interfaces
