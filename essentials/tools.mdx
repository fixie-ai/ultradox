<Info>
<b>Difference from single-generation LLM APIs</b>

Unlike using tools with single-generation LLM APIs, Ultravox Realtime actually calls your tool. This means you need to do a bit more work upfront in defining tools with the proper authentication and parameters.
</Info>

## Built-in Tools
Ultravox Realtime currently includes the following built-in tools.

| Tool Name      | Tool Action                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| queryCorpus    | Retrieves relevant information from an existing corpus (AKA knowledge base). Also see [Query Corpus](/api-reference/corpora/corpus-query).                                                                   |
| hangUp         | Terminates the call. You can also have your own [custom tools end the call](#changing-call-state).                                                                   |
| playDtmfSounds | Plays dual-tone multi-frequency (a.k.a dialpad) tones. See [DTMF](/essentials/telephony#dtmf) for details on sending and receiving tones in your voice applications. |

Aside from being publicly visible, there's nothing special about built-in tools. If you use [list tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list),
you'll see they use the same definitions you can create yourself.

### Using a Built-in Tool
You give your AI agent access tools when you [create the call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) or create a new [call stage](/guides/callstages#creating-and-managing-stages).

```js
// Example request body for creating a call with a built-in tool
{
  "systemPrompt":"You are a helpful assistant. When the call naturally wraps up, use the 'hangUp' tool to end the call.",
  "selectedTools":[
    { "toolName": "hangUp" }
  ]
};

// The toolId can also be used
{
  "systemPrompt":"You are a helpful assistant. When the call naturally wraps up, use the 'hangUp' tool to end the call.",
  "selectedTools":[
    { "toolId": "56294126-5a7d-4948-b67d-3b7e13d55ea7" }
  ]
};
```

**Note:** Using built-in tools is the same as using any other [custom durable tool](#durable-tools) that you have created except for one difference: you can override built-in tools by using the same name.

For example, if you created a durable tool named "hangUp" and then provide that tool by name (i.e. not by the toolId), then your tool would be used instead of the built-in hangUp tool.

### Viewing Tools
To view all tools available to you, including built-in tools, use the [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) API.

<Tip>
The [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) API returns all available built-in tools along with any custom tools that you have created.
</Tip>

## Custom Tools
Custom tools enable you to communicate with the outside world. Anything that you can do in a function can now be done by your agent via a custom tool.


<Tip>
<b>Adding Tools for an Existing API</b>

If you already run a server with a well-defined OpenAPI spec, you can quickly create tools for all your API endpoints by
[uploading that spec](/api-reference/tools/tools-post). Your OpenAPI spec must be either `json` or `yaml` format.

Once uploaded, your tools are just like any other durable tool, so you can use, modify, or delete them as you wish.
</Tip>


### Creating Your First Custom Tool
Let's look at creating a tool that sends an email with a summary of the conversation.

There are three steps:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Tool">
    We need to define the tool and provide it to our agent. The name, description, and dynamic parameters we provide here will be seen by the agent so we need to be thoughtful with them.

    ```js
    // Creating a tool called 'sendConversationSummary'
    //
    // A 'string' parameter named 'conversationSummary'
    // is passed in the body of a POST request to https://foo.bar/sendSummary
    {
      "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
      "selectedTools": [
        {
          "temporaryTool": {
            "modelToolName": "sendConversationSummary",
            "description": "Use this tool at the end of a conversation to send the caller a summary of the conversation.",
            "dynamicParameters": [
              {
                "name": "conversationSummary",
                "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY",
                "schema": {
                  "description": "A 2-3 sentence summary of the conversation.",
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "required": true
              }
            ],
            "http": {
              "baseUrlPattern": "https://foo.bar/sendSummary",
              "httpMethod": "POST"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    What's happening here:
    * We are adding `selectedTools` to the request body of the [`Create Call`](/api-reference/calls/calls-post).
    * There's a single tool named `sendConversationSummary`.
    * This tool requires a single [dynamic parameter](#dynamic-parameters) called `conversationSummary` that is passed in the request body.
    * The tool's functionality is available via POST at the url `https://foo.bar/sendSummary`.
    * The tool is a [temporary tool](#temporary-vs-durable-tools), so it will only be available for this call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement the Function">
    Now that we've defined the tool, let's implement the functionality. This is a simplified example using Express.js and imagines a generic email API provider.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();

    router.post('/sendSummary', async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const { conversationSummary } = req.body;

        // Send the email using our email provider
        sendEmail(conversationSummary);

        return res.status(200).json({
          message: 'Conversation summary sent successfully. Continue the conversation with the user.'
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return res.status(500).json({
          message: 'Internal server error',
          error: error.message
        });
      }
    });

    module.exports = router;
    ```

    This function does the following:
    * Accepts the `conversationSummary` via a POST.
    * Passes the data along to another function (`sendEmail`) that will send it via email.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Instruct the Agent on Tool Use">
    The last thing we need to do is provide additional instructions to the agent on how to use the tool.
    This is primarily done using the tool's own description along with the `systemPrompt`.
    Let's update what we used in the first step.

    ```js

    const updatedPrompt = `
      You're a friendly and fun guy. You like to chat casually while learning more about the person you're chatting with (name, hobbies, likes/dislikes).

      Be casual. Be fun to chat with. Don't talk too much. Keep your sentences pretty short and fun. Let the user guide the conversation.

      As you chat, try and learn more about the person you are talking to such as their name, hobbies, and their likes/dislikes.

      Once you have all the information, call the 'sendSummary' tool to send a summary of the conversation.
    `;
    {
      "systemPrompt": updatedPrompt,
      "selectedTools": [
          // Same as before
      ]
    }
    ```

    We've updated the system prompt that is used when the Ultravox call is created to instruct the agent when and how to use the tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tool Implementations
Every tool needs exactly one implementation. So far we've used `http` tools, but `client` and `dataConnection` tools are also possible.

There are a couple things to note:

<Accordion title="Implementation objects">
  ```js {8-12,19-20,27-28}
  {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
    "selectedTools": [
      {
        "temporaryTool": {
          "modelToolName": "sendEmail",
          ...
          // This tool is implemented via HTTP request.
          "http": {
            "baseUrlPattern": "https://foo.bar/sendEmail",
            "httpMethod": "POST"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "temporaryTool": {
          "modelToolName": "updateScreen",
          ...
          // This tool is implemented by the client.
          "client": {}
        }
      },
      {
        "temporaryTool": {
          "modelToolName": "storeUserInfo",
          ...
          // This tool is implemented by a data connection.
          "dataConnection": {}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client tools require webrtc or websocket call medium.">
  Client tools work best with our client SDKs, which are designed for the webrtc call medium. See [Client Tools](/sdk-reference/introduction#client-tools) to learn how those are registered and used with the [Ultravox Client SDK](/sdk-reference/).

  You can also use client tools with a websocket medium. See the `ClientToolInvocation` and `ClientToolResult` [data messages](/datamessages).

  If you want a similar experience to client tools with a telephony medium, you have two options:

    * Handle telephony using [voximplant](/integrations/voximplant) and define your tools in your voximplant session code
    * Use a data connection. Data connections are like another participant in your calls. Like the client, they can receive tool invocation messages and can send back similar tool result messages. In this case your implementation will live in your websocket server and thus can be used regardless of the call medium used by your client.
</Accordion>


### Tool Requirements
When you define a tool, you can also specify requirements for agents or calls that use the tool. In particular, you can
detail the authentication requirements and any parameters that must be overridden with static values.

#### Tool Authentication
Ultravox has rich support for tool auth. When creating a tool, you must specify what is required for successful auth to the backend service.

Three methods for passing API keys are supported and are used when creating the tool:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Parameter">The API key will be passed via the query string. The name of the parameter must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
  <Step title="Header">The API key will be passed via a custom header. The name of the header must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
  <Step title="HTTP Authentication">The API key will be passed via the HTTP Authentication header. The name of the scheme (e.g. `Bearer`) must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
</Steps>

Your tool can specify multiple options for fulfilling auth requirements (for example if your server allows either query or header auth).
Each option may also contain multiple requirements, for example if your server requires both a user_id and an auth_token for that user.

When defining an agent or creating a call, you pass in the key(s) in the `authTokens` property of `selectedTools`.
If the tokens you provide satisfy multiple options, the first non-empty option whose requirements are all satisfied
will be used. An unauthenticated option, if present, will only be used if no other option can be satisfied.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Query Parameter">
    ```js
    // Create a tool that uses a query parameter called 'apiKey'
    {

            "myServiceApiKey": "your_token_here"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Required parameter overrides
Sometimes your tool will require a parameter to function that you need to have defined when the call is created instead of having the
model come up with a value. In these cases, you can require that the parameter be overridden at call creation.  For example, the
built-in `queryCorpus` tool requires the corpus id to be specified during call creation.

More information about parameters and their overrides is below.


### Tool Parameters
Tool parameters define what gets passed to your implementation when the tool is called. When creating a tool, parameters are defined as one of three types:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Dynamic">The model will choose which values to pass. These are the parameters you'd use for a single-generation LLM API.</Step>
  <Step title="Static">This value is known when the tool is defined and is unconditionally set on invocations. The parameter is not exposed to or set by the model.</Step>
  <Step title="Automatic">Like "Static", except that the value may not be known when the tool is defined but will instead be populated by the system when the tool is invoked.</Step>
</Steps>

#### Dynamic Parameters
Dynamic parameters will have their values set by the model. Creating a dynamic parameter on a tool looks like this:

```js
// Adding a dynamic parameter to a stock price tool
// The parameter will be named 'symbol' and will be passed as a query parameter
{
  "name": "stock_price",
  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol",
  "dynamicParameters": [
    {
      "name": "symbol",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "schema": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)"
      },
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Parameter Overrides
You can choose to set static values for dynamic parameters when you create an agent or start a call. The model won't see any
parameters that you override. When creating a call simply pass in the overrides with each tool, as below. You should also consider
overriding the tool name or description to give the model a more specific understanding of what the tool will do in this case.

```js
// Overriding dynamic parameter when starting a new call
// Always set the stock symbol to 'NVDA'
{
  "systemPrompt": ...
  "selectedTools": [
    "toolName": "stock_price",
    "nameOverride": "nvidia_stock_price",
    "descriptionOverride": "Looks up the current stock price for Nvidia."
    "parameterOverrides": {
      "symbol": "NVDA"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Static Parameters
If you have parameters that are known at the time you create the tool, static parameters can be used.

```js
// Adding a static parameter that always sends utm=ultravox
{
  "name": "stock_price",
  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol",
  "staticParameters": [
    {
      "name": "utm",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "value": "ultravox"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Parameter Overrides
Static parameters can also be overridden when you create an agent or start a call. This is most useful with built-in tools.
For example, the built-in `queryCorpus` tool allows you to statically override `max_results`.

#### Automatic Parameters
Automatic parameters are used when you want a consistent, predictable value (not generated by the model) but you don't know the value when the tool is created.

Here are some of the supported automatic parameters:

| knownValue | Description |
|------|------|
| KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_ID | Used for sending the current Ultravox call ID to the tool. |
| KNOWN_PARAM_CONVERSATION_HISTORY | Includes the full conversation history leading up to this tool call. Typically should be in the body of a request. |
| KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_STATE | Includes arbitrary state previously set by tools. See [Guiding Agents](/guides/guidingagents#tool-state). |


```js
// Adding automatic parameters to a profile creation tool
// There are two parameters added:
// 'call_id' which is sent as a query param
// 'conversation_history' which is sent in the request body
{
  "name": "create_profile",
  "description": "Creates a profile for the current caller",
  "automaticParameters": [
    {
      "name": "call_id",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_ID"
    },
    {
      "name": "conversation_history",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY",
      "knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CONVERSATION_HISTORY"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can find more on Automatic Parameters in the [Base Tool Definition](/api-reference/schema/base-tool-definition).

### Temporary vs. Durable Tools
Custom tools come in two varieties: temporary and durable. There is much more information below but there are a few things to consider right upfront:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">Temporary tools are created in the request body when a new call is created. Durable tools are created using the [Ultravox REST API](/api-reference/tools/tools-post).</Step>
  <Step title="No Functional Difference">There is no functional difference within the context of an Ultravox call between the two tool types.</Step>
  <Step title="Iteration Speed">Temporary tools are great when you are building out a new application and need to iterate.</Step>
  <Step title="Reuse & Collaboration">Durable tools are best when you have things dialed in and want to reuse tools across applications and/or work with a team and want to divide ownership of tools from the rest of your app.</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The distinction between temporary and durable only applies to custom tools. [Built-in](#built-in-tools) tools are always durable.
</Note>

#### Temporary Tools
Temporary tools are created each time you create a new Call and exist exclusively within the context of that call. (Temporary tools aren't visible in the [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) response for example.)

Iteration is faster when using temporary tools because you don't have to create/update/delete tools as you build out your application. You can simply adjust the JSON in the request body and start a new call.

import tempTool from '/snippets/code/temp-tool.mdx'

<tempTool  />

#### Durable Tools
In addition to temporary tools, Ultravox supports the creation of durable tools.
There is no functional difference between durable and temporary tools within the context of a call,
but durable tools are persisted and can be reused across calls or applications. They shine once you
have things dialed in, when you want to share tools across multiple applications, or if you have split
responsibilities on the team.

Use the `/tools` [endpoints](/api-reference/tools/tools-post) to work with durable tools.

To use a durable tool in a call, set the `toolName` or `toolId` field instead of using a `temporaryTool`.

For example:

```js
// Request body for creating an Ultravox call with a durable tool
{
  "systemPrompt": ...
  "selectedTools": [
    "toolName": "stock_price",
  ]
}
```

### Dealing with latency

#### Precomputable Tools
In order to make sure you can always understand why your tool was invoked, by default tool invocations
are always included in the conversation history if they occur at all. To maintain this invariant when
the model produces both text and a tool call, tools cannot be invoked until the agent is done speaking
so that we know the agent won't be interrupted.

This is essential for tools that modify state since there's no good way to revert changes if the agent
is interrupted. However, it's obviously suboptimal for tools like `queryCorpus` where we'd like to look
up information while the agent is speaking and simply ignore the response if the agent is interrupted.
Tools like this can be marked `precomputable`.

Any tool marked `precomputable` will be speculatively invoked as soon as the model produces the tool call.
When the model produces both text and the tool call, the tool's latency can be masked by the agent speaking,
but if the agent is interrupted there will be no record of the invocation.

In order to safely be marked `precomputable`, a tool should have three properties:
1. *No state changes*. For `http` tools, GET requests are usually safe while methods like POST are not.
1. *No side effects*. Even a GET request is not safe to precompute if it has a side effect! (It's up to you to decide what counts here though. Side effects like logging probably don't matter to you for example while any database write likely does.)
1. *Idempotent*. The tool must return the same result when called with the same parameters, regardless of when or how many times it is called.

If your tool meets these requirements, you can mark it `precomputable` using the [corresponding field](/api-reference/tools/tools-post#body-definition-precomputable).

#### Timeouts
While tools are executing, the conversation is essentially frozen. The user can continue talking all they like,
but the agent will never respond until after the tool invocation completes. (The agent does have access to
anything the user said during tool execution once execution completes.)

To users this may feel like the call was disconnected. In order to avoid that, tools are limited to 2.5 seconds
by default. If your tool needs longer than that (and you can't make it faster!), you can increase the timeout up
to 20 seconds by setting the tool's [timeout field](/api-reference/tools/tools-post#body-definition-timeout). You
can also reduce your tool's timeout if you'd like. The value is a duration in seconds, like `5s` for 5 seconds or
`0.1s` for 100 milliseconds.

For tools that take even longer, consider responding immediately and later using an [input_text_message](/datamessages#inputtextmessage)
data message with `deferResponse` with the real tool result. This is easiest with a `dataConnection` implementation
since data connections are also able to send input text messages (and the response is always deferred in that case).
Keep in mind that the model will see whatever response you send back initially, so you'll want to make it clear to
the model what's going on by initially responding with some text like "Tool started. The full response will be available

### Changing Call State
For most tools, the response will include data you want the model to use (e.g. the results of a lookup). However, Ultravox has support for special tool actions that can end the call or change the call stage.

These tool actions require setting a special response type.

| Response Type | Tool Action |
|------|------|
| hang-up | Terminates the call. In addition to having Ultravox end the call after [periods of user inactivity](/api-reference/calls/overview#inactivitymessages), your custom tool can end the call. |
| new-stage | Creates a new call stage. See [here](/guides/callstages) for more. |

How you set the response type depends on your tool implementation.
HTTP tools set the response type via the `X-Ultravox-Response-Type` header.
Client and data connection tools should set the responseType field in their tool result message.

### Controlling Agent Responses to Tools
By default, the agent speaks again immediately after a tool call. This is typically the desired behavior
for tools that gather information since the agent can immediately respond based on the information
retrieved.

However, this may make less sense for other tools. For example, if your agent is gathering information for
the user and you have a tool that allows the agent to store what's been gathered so far, you may want the
agent to speak either before or after the tool but not both.

Ultravox Realtime allows you to define how the agent reacts after a tool call by setting the `agent reaction`.
A default can be set on the tool itself or you can use either the `X-Ultravox-Agent-Reaction` header (for http tools)
or the `agent_reaction` field on the tool result message (for client and data connection tools) similar to how you'd
set a response type (see above).

| Reaction | Description |
|------|------|
| speaks | Agent will speak immediately after the tool call returns. This is the default behavior if agent reaction is not set. Should be used for tools that gather information. |
| listens | Agent listens for user input and doesn't speak. |
| speaks-once | Agent speaks only if it didn't speak immediately before the tool call. Prevents agent repeating things before and after the tool call. |

### Debugging
The Ultravox SDK enables viewing [debug messages](/sdk-reference/introduction#debug-messages) for any active call. These messages include tool calls.

### Best Practices

1. **Clear Naming**: Choose a descriptive and unique name for your tool that clearly indicates its function.

1. **Detailed Description**: Provide a comprehensive description of what the tool does, including any important details about its usage or limitations. This and the name will help the model decide when and how to use your tool.

1. **Precise Parameters**: Define your dynamic parameters carefully, guiding the model to produce values your tool can use. On the implementation side, be careful to validate values and be permissive with allowed presence and formatting if possible.

1. **Error Handling**: Consider how your tool will handle errors or unexpected inputs, and document this behavior in the tool's description.

1. **Iterate Faster**: Use temporary tools when you are building your application. Persist durable tools in the system when things have stabilized.

1. **Version Control**: When updating tools, consider creating a new version (e.g., "stock_price_v2") rather than modifying the existing tool. This allows testing of the new tool before impacting new calls made with the prior version of the tool.

1. **Security**: Be mindful of security when creating tools, especially when they interact with external APIs. Use appropriate authentication methods and avoid exposing sensitive information.

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your tools before deploying them in production conversations to ensure they function as expected.
