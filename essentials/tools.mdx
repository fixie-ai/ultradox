<ToolsPossibilities />

<Info>
<b>Tools in Ultravox are Different</b>

Unlike using tools with single-generation LLM APIs, Ultravox actually calls your tool. This means you need to do a bit more work upfront in defining tools with the proper authentication and parameters.
</Info>

<Warning>
<b>Use ultravox-70B for Tools</b>

While tools are supported across multiple variants of the Ultravox model, using tools with smaller models (i.e. 8B) typically don't work well. YMMV. See [available models](/availablemodels) for more info.
</Warning>

## Built-in Tools
Ultravox currently includes the following built-in tools.

| Tool Name | Tool Action                                                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hangUp    | Terminates the call. You can also have your own [custom tools end the call](#changing-call-state). |

### Using a Built-in Tool
You give your AI agent access tools when you [create the call](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) or create a new [call stage](/guides/callstages#creating-and-managing-stages).

```js
// Example request body for creating a call with a built-in tool
{
  "systemPrompt":"You are a helpful assistant. When the call naturally wraps up, use the 'hangUp' tool to end the call.",
  "selectedTools":[
    { "toolName": "hangUp" }
  ]
};

// The toolId can also be used
{
  "systemPrompt":"You are a helpful assistant. When the call naturally wraps up, use the 'hangUp' tool to end the call.",
  "selectedTools":[
    { "toolId": "56294126-5a7d-4948-b67d-3b7e13d55ea7" }
  ]
};
```

**Note:** Using built-in tools is the same as using any other [custom durable tool](#durable-tools) that you have created except for one difference: you can override built-in tools by using the same name.

For example, if you created a durable tool named "hangUp" and then provide that tool by name (i.e. not by the toolId), then your tool would be used instead of the built-in hangUp tool.

### Viewing Tools
To view all tools available to you, including built-in tools, use the [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) API.

<Tip>
The [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) API returns all available built-in tools along with any custom tools that you have created.
</Tip>

## Custom Tools
Custom tools enable you to communicate with the outside world. Anything that you can do in a function can now be done by your agent via a custom tool.

### Creating Your First Custom Tool
Let's look at creating a tool that sends an email with a summary of the conversation.

There are three steps:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Tool">
    We need to define the tool and provide it to our agent. Everything we provide here will be seen by the agent so we need to be thoughtful of names, descriptions, parameters, etc.

    ```js
    // Creating a tool called 'sendConversationSummary'
    //
    // A 'string' parameter named 'conversationSummary'
    // is passed in the body of a POST request to https://foo.bar/sendSummary
    {
      "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
      "model": "fixie-ai/ultravox",
      "selectedTools": [
        {
          "temporaryTool": {
            "modelToolName": "sendConversationSummary",
            "description": "Use this tool at the end of a conversation to send the caller a summary of the conversation.",
            "dynamicParameters": [
              {
                "name": "conversationSummary",
                "location": "PARAMATER_LOCATION_BODY",
                "schema": {
                  "description": "A 2-3 sentence summary of the conversation.",
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "required": true
              }
            ],
            "http": {
              "baseUrlPattern": "https://foo.bar/sendSummary",
              "httpMethod": "POST"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    What's happening here:
    * We are adding `selectedTools` to the request body of the [`Create Call`](/api-reference/calls/calls-post).
    * There's a single tool named `sendConversationSummary`.
    * This tool requires a single [dynamic parameter](#dynamic-parameters) called `conversationSummary` that is passed in the request body.
    * The tool's functionality is available via POST at the url `https://foo.bar/sendSummary`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement the Function">
    Now that we've defined the tool, let's implement the functionality. This is a simplified example using Express.js and imagines a generic email API provider.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();

    router.post('/sendSummary', async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const { conversationSummary } = req.body;

        // Send the email using our email provider
        sendEmail(conversationSummary);

        return res.status(200).json({
          message: 'Conversation summary sent successfully. Continue the conversation with the user.'
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return res.status(500).json({
          message: 'Internal server error',
          error: error.message
        });
      }
    });

    module.exports = router;
    ```

    This function does the following:
    * Accepts the `conversationSummary` via a POST.
    * Passes the data along to another function (`sendEmail`) that will send it via email.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Instruct the Agent on Tool Use">
    The last thing we need to do is provide additional instructions to the agent on how to use the tool. This is done by adding to the `systemPrompt`. Let's update what we used in the first step.
    
    ```js

    const updatedPrompt = `
      You're a friendly and fun guy. You like to chat casually while learning more about the person you're chatting with (name, hobbies, likes/dislikes). 
      
      Be casual. Be fun to chat with. Don't talk too much. Keep your sentences pretty short and fun. Let the user guide the conversation.
      
      As you chat, try and learn more about the person you are talking to such as their name, hobbies, and their likes/dislikes. 
      
      Once you have all the information, call the 'sendSummary' tool to send a summary of the conversation.
    `;
    {
      "systemPrompt": updatedPrompt,
      "model": "fixie-ai/ultravox",
      "selectedTools": [
          // Same as before
      ]
    }
    ```

    We've updated the system prompt that is used when the Ultravox call is created to instruct the agent when and how to use the tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Server vs. Client Tools
You can implement your tools as either server (the tool's functionality is exposed via a URL) or client (the tool's functionality is implemented in your client application) tools. From the perspective of Ultravox Realtime, there is no difference between server or client tools. When the model chooses to call a tool, Ultravox will simply call the tool however it's defined.

There are a couple things to note:

<Accordion title="Server tools are defined using `http`. Client tools are defined using `client`">
  ```js {8-11,18}
  {
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
    "selectedTools": [
      {
        "temporaryTool": {
          "modelToolName": "sendEmail",
          ...
          "http": {
            "baseUrlPattern": "https://foo.bar/sendEmail",
            "httpMethod": "POST"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "temporaryTool": {
          "modelToolName": "updateScreen",
          ...
          "client": {}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client tools are only available if you are using our client SDK.">
  See [Client Tools](/sdk-reference/introduction#client-tools) to learn how those are registered and used with the [Ultravox Client SDK](/sdk-reference/).
</Accordion>


### Tool Authentication
Ultravox has rich support for tools auth. When creating a tool, you must specify what is required for successful auth to the backend service.

Three methods for passing API keys are supported and are used when creating the tool:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Query Parameter">The API key will be passed via the query string. The name of the parameter must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
  <Step title="Header">The API key will be passed via a custom header. The name of the header must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
  <Step title="HTTP Authentication">The API key will be passed via the HTTP Authentication header. The name of the scheme (e.g. `Bearer`) must be provided when the tool is created.</Step>
</Steps>

You then pass in the key(s) in the `authTokens` property of `selectedTools` when creating a call.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Query Parameter">
    ```js
    // Create a tool that uses a query parameter called 'apiKey'
    {
      "name": "stock_price"
      "definition": {
        "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol",

                }

                  }
                }

                }

          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Tool Parameters
Tool parameters define what gets passed in to your backend service when the tool is called. When creating a tool, parameters are defined as one of three types:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Dynamic">The model will choose which values to pass. These are the parameters you'd use for a single-generation LLM API. Can be overridden using Parameter Overrides (see [below](#dynamic-parameters)).</Step>
  <Step title="Static">Value is known when the tool is defined and is unconditionally set on invocations. Not exposed to or set by the model.</Step>
  <Step title="Automatic">Like "Static", except that the value may not be known when the tool is defined but will instead be populated by the system when the tool is invoked.</Step>
</Steps>

#### Dynamic Parameters
Dynamic parameters will have their values set by the model. Creating a dynamic parameter on a tool looks like this:

```js
// Adding a dynamic parameter to a stock price tool
// The parameter will be named 'symbol' and will be passed as a query parameter
{
  "name": "stock_price",
  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol",
  "dynamicParameters": [
    {
      "name": "symbol",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "schema": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)"
      },
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Parameter Overrides
You can choose to set static values for dynamic parameters when you start a call. The model won't see any parameters that you override. When creating a call simply pass in the overrides with each tool:

```js
// Overriding dynamic parameter when starting a new call
// Always set the stock symbol to 'NVDA'
{
  "model": "fixie-ai/ultravox-70B",
  "systemPrompt": ...
  "selectedTools": [
    "toolName": "stock_price",
    "parameterOverrides": {
      "symbol": "NVDA"
    }
  ]
}
```

Parameter overrides don't make sense for temporary tools. Instead of overriding a dynamic parameter, use a static parameter instead.

#### Static Parameters
If you have parameters that are known at the time you create the tool, static parameters can be used.

```js
// Adding a static parameter that always sends utm=ultravox
{
  "name": "stock_price",
  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol",
  "staticParameters": [
    {
      "name": "utm",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "value": "ultravox"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Automatic Parameters
Automatic parameters are used when you want a consistent, predictable value (not generated by the model) but you don't know the value when the tool is created.

There are currently two use cases:

* **Call ID** → Used for sending the current Ultravox call ID to the tool. Can be used to provide a unique identifier or for logging purposes. Example: you want to store the call ID in your CRM as part of the current caller's record.

Use `"knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_ID"`.

* **Conversation History** → Sends the entire conversation history up to that point to the tool. Primarily used for tools that create a new call stage or when you want a tool to do something with the messages. Example: Pre-process conversation history messages when changing call stage and dynamically updating the system prompt for the new stage.

Use `"knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CONVERSATION_HISTORY"`.

```js
// Adding automatic parameters to a profile creation tool
// There are two parameters added:
// 'call_id' which is sent as a query param
// 'conversation_history' which is sent in the request body
{
  "name": "create_profile",
  "description": "Creates a profile for the current caller",
  "automaticParameters": [
    {
      "name": "call_id",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY",
      "knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CALL_ID"
    },
    {
      "name": "conversation_history",
      "location": "PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY",
      "knownValue": "KNOWN_PARAM_CONVERSATION_HISTORY"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can find more on Automatic Parameters in the [Base Tool Definition](/api-reference/schema/base-tool-definition).

### Temporary vs. Durable Tools
Custom tools come in two varieties: temporary and durable. There is much more information below but there are a few things to consider right upfront:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">Temporary tools are created in the request body when a new call is created. Durable tools are created using the [Ultravox REST API](/api-reference/tools/tools-post).</Step>
  <Step title="No Functional Difference">There is no functional difference within the context of an Ultravox call between the two tool types.</Step>
  <Step title="Iteration Speed">Temporary tools are great when you are building out a new application and need to iterate.</Step>
  <Step title="Reuse & Collaboration">Durable tools are best when you have things dialed in and want to reuse tools across applications and/or work with a team and want to divide ownership of tools from the rest of your app.</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The distinction between temporary and durable only applies to custom tools. [Built-in](#built-in-tools) tools are always durable.
</Note>

#### Temporary Tools
Temporary tools are created each time you create a new Call and exist exclusively within the context of that call. (Temporary tools aren't visible in the [List Tools](/api-reference/tools/tools-list) response for example.)

Iteration is faster when using temporary tools because you don't have to create/update/delete tools as you build out your application. You can simply adjust the JSON in the request body and start a new call.

#### Creating & Using Temporary Tools
Temporary tools are defined and passed in the request body of the [`Create Call`](/api-reference/calls/calls-post) endpoint. They are available during the current call.

import tempTool from '/snippets/code/temp-tool.mdx'

<tempTool  />

#### Durable Tools
In addition to temporary tools, Ultravox supports the creation of durable tools. There is no functional difference between durable and temporary tools within the context of a call.

Durable tools are persisted and can be reused across calls or applications. They shine once you have things dialed in, when you want to share tools across multiple applications, or if you have split responsibilities on the team.

#### Creating Durable Tools
The `/tools` endpoint in the Ultravox API is for working with durable tools. You create durable tools either by uploading an OpenAPI spec or via the request body in the [`Create Tool`](/api-reference/tools/tools-post) endpoint. Your OpenAPI spec must be either `json` or `yaml` format.

#### Using Durable Tools
To use a durable tool in a call, set the `toolName` or `toolId` field instead of using a `temporaryTool`.

For example:

```js
// Request body for creating an Ultravox call with a durable tool
{
  "model": "fixie-ai/ultravox-70B",
  "systemPrompt": ...
  "selectedTools": [
    "toolName": "stock_price",
  ]
}
```

## Additional Information

### Changing Call State
For most tools, the response will include data you want the model to use (e.g. the results of a lookup). However, Ultravox has support for special tool actions that can end the call or change the call stage.

These tool actions require setting a special response type.

| Response Type | Tool Action |
|------|------|
| hang-up | Terminates the call. In addition to having Ultravox end the call after [periods of user inactivity](/api-reference/calls/overview#inactivitymessages), your custom tool can end the call. |
| new-stage | Creates a new call stage. See [here](/guides/callstages) for more. |

How you set the response type depends on if you are using a server/HTTP or a client tool:

**Server/HTTP Tools**

Server tools must respond with the `X-Ultravox-Response-Type` header set to either `hang-up` or `new-stage`

**Client Tools**

For client tools, set `responseType="hang-up"` or `responseType="new-stage"` on your `ClientToolResult` object.

### Debugging
The Ultravox SDK enables viewing [debug messages](/sdk-reference/introduction#debug-messages) for any active call. These messages include tool calls.

### Tool Definition Schema
The `definition` object in the tool creation and update requests follows the [BaseToolDefinition schema](/api-reference/schema/base-tool-definition).

Here's a breakdown of its main components:

- `description` (string): A clear, concise description of what the tool does.
- `dynamicParameters` (array, optional): List of parameters that can be set by the AI model when using the tool. Each parameter is an object containining:
  - `name` (string): The name of the parameter.
  - `location` (string): Where the parameter is used ("PARAMETER_LOCATION_QUERY", "PARAMETER_LOCATION_PATH", "PARAMETER_LOCATION_HEADER", "PARAMETER_LOCATION_BODY").
  - `schema` (object): JSON Schema definition of the parameter. This typically includes things like type, description, enum values, format, other restrictions, etc.
  - `required` (boolean): Whether the parameter is required.
- `staticParameters` (array, optional): List of parameters that are always set to a known, fixed value when the tool is used. These are unconditionally added when the tool is invoked. These parameters are not exposed to or set by the model. Example: you use an API for various things but want to track which requests come from your Ultravox app so you always append `utm=ultravox` to the query parameters.
- `automaticParameters` (array, optional): Additional parameters automatically set by the system. Used when the value is not known when the tool is created but that will be known when the tool is called. Example: you want to use the unique `call_id` from ultravox as a key in your backend and you have the tool include `call_id` in the request body when your tool's API is called.
- `requirements` (object, optional): Any specific requirements for using the tool. Currently this is used for security (e.g. API keys or HTTP Auth).
- `http` (object): Details for invoking the tool via HTTP. For server tools.
  - `baseUrlPattern` (string): The base URL pattern for  the tool, possibly with placeholders for path parameters.
  - `httpMethod` (string): The HTTP method for the tool (e.g., "GET", "POST").
- `client` (object): Declares the tool as a client tool. Exactly one of `http` or `client` must be set for a tool.

### Best Practices for Creating Tools

1. **Clear Naming**: Choose a descriptive and unique name for your tool that clearly indicates its function.

1. **Detailed Description**: Provide a comprehensive description of what the tool does, including any important details about its usage or limitations. This and the name will help the model decide when and how to use your tool.

1. **Precise Parameters**: Define your dynamic parameters carefully, ensuring that the AI model has all the information it needs to use the tool effectively.

1. **Error Handling**: Consider how your tool will handle errors or unexpected inputs, and document this behavior in the tool's description.

1. **Iterate Faster**: Use temporary tools when you are building your application. Persist durable tools in the system when things have stabilized.

1. **Version Control**: When updating tools, consider creating a new version (e.g., "stock_price_v2") rather than modifying the existing tool. This allows testing of the new tool before impacting new calls made with the prior version of the tool.

1. **Security**: Be mindful of security when creating tools, especially when they interact with external APIs. Use appropriate authentication methods and avoid exposing sensitive information.

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your tools before deploying them in production conversations to ensure they function as expected.
