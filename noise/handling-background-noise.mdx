# Handling Background Noise

Background noise is one of the most common challenges in voice applications. Ultravox includes built-in noise cancellation, but certain environments may require additional strategies or VAD adjustments.

## Types of Background Noise

Understanding different noise types helps you choose the right approach:

### Constant Background Noise
**Examples:** Air conditioning, traffic, machinery, office ambiance
**Characteristics:** Consistent volume and frequency, predictable patterns

**Built-in Handling:** Ultravox's noise cancellation models excel at filtering constant background noise.

### Variable Environmental Noise  
**Examples:** Construction, outdoor environments, busy public spaces
**Characteristics:** Unpredictable volume changes, varying frequencies

**Challenges:** Sudden loud noises can trigger false VAD activation or mask speech.

### Electronic Interference
**Examples:** Phone notifications, computer fans, electrical hum
**Characteristics:** Often in specific frequency ranges, may be intermittent

**Solutions:** Usually require hardware-level filtering or environment changes.

### Audio System Noise
**Examples:** Microphone static, echo, feedback, compression artifacts
**Characteristics:** Introduced by the audio capture/transmission chain

**Prevention:** Address at the source through better hardware or audio setup.

## Ultravox's Built-in Noise Handling

Ultravox automatically handles many noise scenarios:

### Noise Cancellation Models
- **Spectral filtering** → Removes consistent background frequencies
- **Adaptive filtering** → Adjusts to changing noise patterns  
- **Voice isolation** → Enhances human speech frequencies
- **Real-time processing** → Works during live conversations

### Intelligent VAD Integration
- **Context-aware decisions** → Uses conversation state to filter noise-triggered events
- **Multi-model validation** → Cross-checks VAD triggers against other models
- **Adaptive thresholds** → Adjusts sensitivity based on detected noise levels

## When to Adjust VAD for Noise

Consider VAD adjustments when built-in noise cancellation isn't sufficient:

### Extremely Noisy Environments

For industrial settings, construction sites, or very busy public spaces:

```javascript
vadSettings: {
  frameActivationThreshold: 0.3,  // Less sensitive to background noise
  minimumTurnDuration: "0.2s",    // Ignore very brief noise spikes
  turnEndpointDelay: "0.5s"       // Wait longer to ensure user is done
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Reduces false triggers from noise
- May miss quiet speech or brief responses
- Slightly higher response latency

### Intermittent Loud Noises

For environments with occasional loud interruptions (sirens, announcements, machinery):

```javascript
vadSettings: {
  minimumInterruptionDuration: "0.2s",  // Prevent false interruptions
  frameActivationThreshold: 0.2         // Moderate noise filtering
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Prevents noise from interrupting agent speech
- May delay legitimate user interruptions
- Balances sensitivity with noise tolerance

## Environmental Solutions

Hardware and environment improvements often work better than VAD adjustments:

### Microphone Selection
**Directional microphones** → Focus on speech from specific directions
**Noise-canceling microphones** → Hardware-level noise reduction
**Close-proximity setup** → Reduces noise-to-speech ratio

### Environmental Control
**Quiet zones** → Designate low-noise areas for voice interactions
**Sound dampening** → Carpets, curtains, and soft furnishings reduce echo and noise
**Noise source management** → Turn off unnecessary fans, machines, or audio sources

### Audio Processing Pipeline
**Pre-processing** → Client-side noise reduction before sending to Ultravox
**Audio quality optimization** → Proper gain levels, sample rates, and encoding
**Network considerations** → Stable connections prevent compression artifacts

## Troubleshooting Common Noise Issues

### Agent Responds to Background Noise

**Symptoms:** Agent starts speaking when only background noise is present

**Diagnosis:**
1. Test in a quiet environment to isolate the issue
2. Check if noise is consistent or intermittent
3. Verify microphone positioning and settings

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Increase activation threshold
vadSettings: {
  frameActivationThreshold: 0.4,
  minimumTurnDuration: "0.3s"
}
```

### Agent Misses Quiet Speech

**Symptoms:** Agent doesn't respond to soft-spoken or distant users

**Diagnosis:**
1. Test with normal speaking volume at close range
2. Check microphone sensitivity and gain settings
3. Verify no audio processing is reducing input levels

**Solutions:**
- Improve microphone setup rather than lowering VAD thresholds
- Use directional microphones to focus on the speaker
- Educate users about optimal speaking distance and volume

### Noise Interrupts Agent Speech

**Symptoms:** Agent stops talking when background noise occurs

**Diagnosis:**
1. Identify if interruptions correlate with specific noise events
2. Test the duration and volume of interrupting sounds
3. Check if the noise has speech-like characteristics

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Require longer duration for interruptions
vadSettings: {
  minimumInterruptionDuration: "0.3s"
}
```

## Testing Noise Handling

### Systematic Testing Approach

1. **Baseline Testing** → Establish performance in ideal conditions
2. **Controlled Noise Introduction** → Add specific types of noise gradually
3. **Real-world Validation** → Test in actual deployment environments
4. **User Feedback Collection** → Gather subjective experience data

### Noise Testing Scenarios

**Constant Background Noise**
- Test with different volume levels of consistent noise
- Verify speech recognition accuracy
- Check for false VAD triggers

**Variable Noise**
- Introduce sudden loud sounds
- Test with overlapping noise sources
- Verify agent speech isn't interrupted inappropriately

**Edge Cases**
- Very quiet environments (echo effects)
- Very loud environments (masking effects)
- Noise with speech-like characteristics

## Best Practices

### Start with Environment, Not Settings

1. **Optimize hardware** → Use quality microphones with noise reduction
2. **Control environment** → Reduce noise sources when possible
3. **Educate users** → Teach optimal speaking practices
4. **Monitor performance** → Use real-world testing to validate

### When VAD Adjustment Is Necessary

<Note>
  <b>Conservative Approach</b>
  
  Make minimal, incremental changes to VAD settings. Every adjustment is a trade-off that affects the overall conversation experience.
</Note>

**Safe Starting Points:**
- Increase `frameActivationThreshold` by 0.1 increments
- Add 100-200ms to `minimumTurnDuration` for noisy environments
- Extend `minimumInterruptionDuration` to prevent false interruptions

**Test Thoroughly:**
- Use real users in realistic conditions
- Test edge cases (very quiet speech, multiple speakers, etc.)
- Monitor both subjective experience and objective metrics

Remember: Ultravox's built-in noise handling is sophisticated and effective for most scenarios. Environmental and hardware improvements often provide better results than VAD adjustments, with fewer trade-offs.
