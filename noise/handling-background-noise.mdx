Ultravox Realtime provides robust, built-in support for handling background noise and challenging acoustic environments. The system is designed to deliver clear voice interactions even in noisy real-world conditions.

<Note>
  <b>Automatic Protection</b>
  
  Background noise handling is enabled by default for all Ultravox calls. No configuration is required to benefit from these capabilities.

## Multi-Layer Noise Handling

Ultravox employs a comprehensive approach to noise management through multiple integrated components:

**Krisp Noise Cancellation** → Advanced noise suppression technology that filters out background sounds in real-time.

**Model Training** → The Ultravox model is specifically trained to recognize and process speech in noisy environments, understanding end user intent and context even when audio quality is compromised.

**Custom Architecture** → A specialized low-latency architecture that seamlessly integrates noise handling components while maintaining real-time performance.

The result is natural, clear voice interactions that work reliably across diverse acoustic conditions, allowing your AI agents to perform effectively in real-world environments.
