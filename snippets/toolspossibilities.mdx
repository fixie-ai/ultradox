    Tools in Ultravox (also known as function calling) are a powerful way to extend your agents' capabilities by connecting them to external services and systems. At their core, tools are simply functions that agents can invoke to perform specific actions or retrieve information.
    <br /><br />
    Ultravox includes <a href="/tools/built-in-tools">built-in tools</a> and you can <a href="/tools/http-vs-client-tools">create custom tools</a>.
    <br /><br />
    Here are some of the things you can do with tools:

    <Card title="Communicate with the Outside world" icon="earth-americas">
      Lookup the weather, get movie times, create calendar events, or send emails.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Order Lookup" icon="cart-shopping">
      Lookup orders, backordered items, or provide shipment updates.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Knowledge Base" icon="circle-info">
      Consult product and support documentation for contextual support.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Create Support Case" icon="message-question">
      Open tailored support cases for human follow-up.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Transfer Call" icon="swap">
      Hand-off or escalate calls to human support agents.
    </Card>
    <Card title="End Call" icon="phone-hangup">
      End calls due to user inactivity or after successful resolution.
    </Card>
  </CardGroup>
  <br />
  Any functionality you can encapsulate in a function can be exposed to your agents as a tool. Addtionally, unlike other LLM APIs where you have to handle tool calls yourself, Ultravox actually executes your tools during live conversations, enabling real-time interactions with external systems, databases, and APIs.
