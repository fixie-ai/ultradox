### API Limits
We restrict the number of total API requests per second. This restriction applies to all API endpoints that are part of `https://api.ultravox.ai/api/`.

We restrict at the account and API key level as follows:

| Level          | API Requests per Second |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| <b>Account</b> | 500                     |
| <b>API Key</b> | 200                     |

### Call Creation Limits
In addition to the overall [API limits](#api-limits) above, we place additional restrictions on how quickly accounts can create calls in the system.

| Plan Type    | Per Second | Per Minute |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Free / PAYGO | 5          | 30         |
| Pro          | 10         | 120        |
| Scale        | 30         | 360        |

> _Call creation is limited by whichever threshold is reached first (per second or per minute)._
