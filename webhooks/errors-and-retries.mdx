## Retrying Failed Webhook Event Deliveries
If your webhook endpoint is temporarily unavailable or returns an error status code (e.g. 4xx or 5xx), Ultravox will automatically retry delivery using an exponential backoff strategy.

We'll make up to 10 retry attempts over several hours as follows:

* First retry will occur approximately 30 seconds later.
* Subsequent retries will double the retry interval. (e.g. second retry again after 1m, third retry after 2m, etc.)
* Total of 10 retries.

For permanent failures or extended downtime, you can always use our REST API to retrieve information about any calls/events you may have missed.
