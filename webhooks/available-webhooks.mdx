Ultravox offers several webhook events that you can subscribe to for real-time notifications. Each event provides detailed information about what happened in your account.

## Available Events
The following events are available and can be specified when creating or updating a webhoook.

| event        | description                  |
|------------- | ---------------------------- |
| call.started | Fired when a call starts.    |
| call.ended   | Fired when a call ends.      |
| call.joined  | Fired when a call is joined. |

### Event Payload Reference

All webhooks follow a consistent structure. The payload always includes:
- **event**: The type of event that triggered the webhook.
- **call**: Complete call object matching our API response format.

      "call": {
        "callId": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
        "clientVersion": "<string>",

#### Event Name
The `event` field contains the exact event name you subscribed to:
- `"call.started"`
- `"call.ended"`  
- `"call.joined"`

#### Call Object
The `call` object contains the complete [call definition](/api-reference/schema/call-definition), identical to what you'd receive from the [Get Call API endpoint](/api-reference/calls/calls-get). This ensures consistency across your application whether you're receiving webhook data or making API requests.

**Key call object fields:**
- `callId`: Unique call identifier
- `created`: Timestamp when call was created
- `joined`: Timestamp when call was joined
- `ended`: Timestamp when call was ended
- `shortSummary`: Short summary of the call
- `metadata`: Custom metadata you've associated with the call

See the [Call definition schema](/api-reference/schema/call-definition) for the complete list of fields.

## Webhook Configuration

When creating or updating a webhook, specify which events you want to receive:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ultravox.ai/api/webhooks \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/ultravox",
    "events": ["call.started", "call.ended"],
    "secrets": ["your-webhook-secret"]
  }'
```

## HTTP Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must meet these requirements:

**Accept POST Requests**: All webhooks are sent as HTTP POST requests.

**Return 2xx Status**: Return any 2xx status code (we recommend 204) to acknowledge receipt.

**Respond Quickly**: Respond quickly to avoid timeouts.

**Handle JSON**: Parse the JSON payload from the request body.

```js Example: Handling Webhook Events
// Express.js webhook handler example
app.post('/ultravox-webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  switch (event.event) {
    case 'call.started':
      console.log('Call started:', event.call.callId);
      // Initialize any required resources
      break;
      
    case 'call.joined':
      console.log('User joined call:', event.call.callId);
      // Update UI, start monitoring, etc.
      break;
      
    case 'call.ended':
      console.log('Call ended:', event.call.callId, 'Reason:', event.call.endReason);
      // Clean up resources, analyze results, etc.
      break;
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Error Responses

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code (e.g. 4xx or 5xx), Ultravox will retry delivery. See [Error Handling & Retries](./errors-and-retries) for more details.

## Testing Webhooks

During development, consider using tools like:
- **ngrok**: Expose local development servers to receive webhooks
- **webhook.site**: Test webhook payloads without writing code  
- **Postman**: Mock webhook endpoints for testing

Remember that webhook events reflect real activity in your Ultravox account, so test carefully to avoid processing duplicate or test data in production systems.
