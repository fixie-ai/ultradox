<Info>
  <b>Get an API Key</b>

  Using the Ultravox API requires an API key.

  You can [sign-up](https://app.ultravox.ai) for a free account that comes with 30 free minutes for creating calls.
</Info>

## Base URL
The Ultravox API is available at `https://api.ultravox.ai/api/`.

## API Keys
Ultravox API keys are 41 characters long and are made up of two alphanumeric parts separated by a period. The first part is 8 characters long and the second is 32 characters.

For example: `Zk9Ht7Lm.wX7pN9fM3kLj6tRq2bGhA8yE5cZvD4sT`

Throughout the docs we use `aBCDef.123456` for brevity.

## X-API-Key Header
When making API calls, pass your key in using the `X-API-Key` header.

<Warning>
  <b>You should never expose your API key to client code</b>

  If you *really* want to ignore this advice for a local demo, use the X-Unsafe-API-Key header instead at your own risk. It works the same way except that our server will allow it in CORS preflight requests.
</Warning>

Here's an example showing how to use the fictional API key `aBCDef.123456` to get a list of calls:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls \
--header 'X-API-Key: aBCDef.123456'
```

```js JavaScript
fetch('https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'aBCDef.123456'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limits
The Ultravox API includes safeguards to help maximize stability for all customers. Too many requests can trigger an error with status code `429`.

### API Limits
We restrict the number of API requests per second. We restrict at the account and API key level as follows:
* **Account**: 500 requests per second
* **API Key**: 200 requests per second

### Call Concurrency Limits
Accounts can have five concurrent calls. That means any calls that have been created and that are not yet ended.

Contact us if you need higher call concurrency limits. Ultravox can scale to thousands of concurrent calls per account.

## Playground
If you want to quickly experiment with prompts and voices, the fastest way to do that is in the [Ultravox Dashboard](https://app.ultravox.ai/playground).

You can also paste in an Ultravox API key throughout the API reference (look for "Authorization" and paste your key where it asks for `X-API-Key`) and test the REST API endpoints.
