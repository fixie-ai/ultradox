<Info>
  <b>Get an API Key</b>

  Using the Ultravox API requires an API key.

  You can [sign-up](https://app.ultravox.ai) for a free account that comes with 30 free minutes for creating calls.
</Info>

## Base URL
The Ultravox API is available at `https://api.ultravox.ai/api/`.

## API Keys
Ultravox API keys are 41 characters long and are made up of two alphanumeric parts separated by a period. The first part is 8 characters long and the second is 32 characters.

For example: `Zk9Ht7Lm.wX7pN9fM3kLj6tRq2bGhA8yE5cZvD4sT`

Throughout the docs we use `aBCDef.123456` for brevity.

## X-API-Key Header
When making API calls, pass your key in using the `X-API-Key` header.

<Warning>
  <b>You should never expose your API key to client code</b>

  If you *really* want to ignore this advice for a local demo, use the X-Unsafe-API-Key header instead at your own risk. It works the same way except that our server will allow it in CORS preflight requests.
</Warning>

Here's an example showing how to use the fictional API key `aBCDef.123456` to get a list of calls:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl --request GET \
--url https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls \
--header 'X-API-Key: aBCDef.123456'
```

```js JavaScript
fetch('https://api.ultravox.ai/api/calls', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'aBCDef.123456'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limits
The Ultravox API includes safeguards to help maximize stability for all customers. Too many API requests can trigger an error with status code `429`. See [Scaling & Call Concurrency](/gettingstarted/concurrency) for more information on `429` errors and how to properly handle them.

### Call Concurrency Limits
The number of concurrent calls allowed depends on your plan.

<ConcurrencyTable />

See [Scaling & Call Concurrency](/gettingstarted/concurrency) for more details on how call concurrency works in Ultravox Realtime.

## Playground
If you want to quickly experiment with prompts and voices, the fastest way to do that is in the [Ultravox Dashboard](https://app.ultravox.ai/playground).

You can also paste in an Ultravox API key throughout the API reference (look for "Authorization" and paste your key where it asks for `X-API-Key`) and test the REST API endpoints.
