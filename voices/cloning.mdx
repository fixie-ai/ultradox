Ultravox Realtime includes multiple, high-quality voices for all supported languages. The fastest way to experience the included voices is in the [Voices explorer](https://app.ultravox.ai/voices) in the web console. You can also use the [List Voices](/api-reference/voices/voices-list) endpoint to see all voices and their details.

## Creating a Custom Voice
<VoiceCloneLimit />

You can create a custom voice by uploading an audio sample using the [Create (Clone) Voice](/api-reference/voices/voices-post) endpoint. This process allows you to generate a unique voice that matches the characteristics of your audio sample.

### Prerequisites

- An Ultravox Realtime API key
- A single audio file containing a clear voice sample (30 seconds recommended)
- The audio file must be in .mp3 or .wav format

### Using the API

To create a custom voice, send a POST request to the `/api/voices` endpoint with your audio file. Note: multiple files are not supported.

Here's how to do it:

```bash
curl --request POST https://api.ultravox.ai/api/voices \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --form 'file=@"/path/to/your/audio-sample.wav"'
  --form 'name=My Custom Voice' \
  --form 'description=Voice recorded on Jan 1, 2024'
```

### Requirements for Audio Samples

For optimal results, ensure your audio sample meets these criteria:

- Clear, high-quality audio without background noise or echo
- Single speaker throughout the recording
- Natural speaking pace and tone
- No music or other voices in the background
- 30-60 seconds in length (longer samples do not typically lead to better clones)

### Limitations

- Maximum of one audio file per voice
- 10MB file size maximum
