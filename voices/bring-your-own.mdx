Ultravox Realtime allows you to bring your own TTS provider to have your agent sound however you like.

<Note>
  <b>Advanced Feature</b>

  Integrating your own TTS provider means you're responsible for speech generation issues.
  You'll need to work with your provider to ensure your requests will be fulfilled reliably and quickly
  and will sound the way you want. If you encounter generation errors, see [Debugging](#debugging) below.
</Note>

## Setting up your account

To use your own TTS provider, you'll need to add your API key for that provider to your Ultravox account.
You can do that in the [Ultravox console](https://app.ultravox.ai/settings/) or using the
[Set TTS API keys endpoint](/api-reference/accounts/accounts-me-tts-api-keys-partial-update).

<Note>
  <b>Generic option</b>

  You can skip this step if you're using the "generic" ExternalVoice integration.
</Note>

## Providers

When setting an [ExternalVoice](/api-reference/calls/calls-post#body-external-voice) on your agent or call,
there are a few different providers available. The named providers such as ElevenLabs and Cartesia have
customized integrations that make their voices work as smoothly as possible with Ultravox. This typically means
Ultravox uses their streaming API and takes advantage of audio timing information from the provider to
synchronize transcripts.  While you'll still need to work with the provider to ensure your agent's requests will
be fulfilled reliably and quickly, you can be confident that Ultravox knows how to interact with your provider.

If you'd like to use some other TTS provider, you may be able to get by with our "generic" integration option.
This route gives you much more flexibility to define requests to your provider. Any provider that accepts json
post requests and that returns either WAV or raw PCM audio (including within JSON bodies) ought to work.

Since generic integrations don't stream text in (but can stream audio out) Ultravox has to buffer input text
before sending it to your provider, which means slightly higher agent response times and possible audio
discontinuities at sentence boundaries.

Additionally since generic integrations don't provide audio timing information, transcript timing must be approximated.
Once Ultravox has a full generation (and therefore the true audio duration), it assumes each character requires
the same duration and approximates transcripts based on that. While the first generation is still streaming, Ultravox
relies on an estimated words-per-minute speaking rate to approximate transcripts.

### Eleven Labs

Eleven Labs is our most commonly used provider (and as of May 2025 backs most of our internal voices). We use
their websocket API to stream text in and audio out in parallel. Eleven Labs provides character-level timing
information alongside audio, ensuring transcripts are kept in sync and conversation history accurately reflects
what was spoken in the event of an interruption.

<Note>
  <b>Slurring</b>

  Eleven Labs seems much more likely to slur words or generally hallucinate audio in the past couple months.
  Several of their customers (including Ultravox) have reported this and it is being worked on. In the meantime,
  prompting your agent to avoid special characters like asterisks may be helpful. Alternatively, you could try
  their more robust (but slower) multilingual model.
</Note>

```json
"elevenLabs": {
  "voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",
  "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5"
}
```

### Cartesia

Cartesia also provides many high quality voices. We use their websocket API to stream text in and audio out in
parallel. Cartesia provides word-level timing information interspersed with audio, helping to keep transcripts
in sync with audio.

```json
"cartesia": {
  "voiceId": "af346552-54bf-4c2b-a4d4-9d2820f51b6c",
  "model": "sonic-2"
}
```

### LMNT

LMNT's "aurora" model lags the other providers in terms of quality, though their experimental "blizzard" model shows
potential. LMNT has by far the simplest streaming integration (and the only SDK worth using). They also offer unlimited
concurrency and no rate limits even on their $10/month plan. Like Eleven Labs and Cartesia, LMNT allows for streaming
text in and audio out in parallel and provides audio timing information to help Ultravox align transcripts with speech.

```json
"lmnt": {
  "voiceId": "lily",
  "model": "blizzard"
}
```

### Deepgram

Deepgram's latest Aura-2 model claims to be in line with other providers in terms of quality. However, it isn't supported
in their streaming API yet and Ultravox has no special integration with it yet as a result. That said, you can use our
"generic" ExternalVoice to give Deepgram a try now using their REST API.

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-2-asteria-en&encoding=linear16&sample_rate=48000&container=none",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "text": "{text}"
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 48000
}
```

### Google

Google's TTS API returns json, so it requires an extra `jsonAudioFieldPath` in your generic ExternalVoice.

```json
{
  "url": "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "input": {"text": "{text}"},
    "voice": {
      "languageCode": "en-US",
      "name": "en-US-Chirp3-HD-Charon"
    },
    "audioConfig": {
      "audioEncoding": "LINEAR16",
      "speakingRate": 1.0,
      "sampleRateHertz": 48000
    }
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 48000,
  "jsonAudioFieldPath": "audioContent"
}
```

### OpenAI

OpenAI also has a TTS API you can use with our generic ExternalVoice option.

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  "body": {
    "input": "{text}",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    "voice": "shimmer",
    "response_format": "pcm",
    "speed": 1.0
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 24000
}
```

### Resemble

Resemble also has a TTS API you can use with our generic ExternalVoice option.

```json
{
  "url": "https://p.cluster.resemble.ai/stream",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_RESEMBLE_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "audio/wav"
  },
  "body": {
    "data": "{text}",
    "voice_uuid": "0842fdf9",
    "precision": "PCM_16",
    "sample_rate": 44100
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 44100
}
```

### Orpheus

Orpheus is an open-source TTS model with a Llama 3 backbone. Along with several similar models, Orpheus
likely represents the next generation of realism for AI voices. They've partnered with baseten to provide a
simple [self-hosting option](https://www.baseten.co/library/orpheus-tts/) you can set up for yourself.

You can use a generic ExternalVoice with your self-hosted Orpheus instance:

```json
{
  "url": "YOUR_BASETEN_DEPLOYMENT_URL",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Api-Key YOUR_BASETEN_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "prompt": "{text}",
    "request_id": "SOME_UUID",
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "voice": "tara",
    "stop_token_ids": [128258, 128009]
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 24000,
  "responseMimeType": "audio/l16"
}
```


### Inworld
Inworld's TTS API returns json, so it requires an extra `jsonAudioFieldPath` field. To use the streaming endpoint, you'll also need to override the `responseMimeType` field so we know to treat the response as [json lines](https://jsonlines.org/).

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.inworld.ai/tts/v1/voice:stream",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Basic YOUR_INWORLD_BASIC_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": {
    "voiceId": "Hades",
    "modelId": "inworld-tts-1",
    "text": "{text}",
    "audioConfig": {
        "audioEncoding": "LINEAR16",
        "speakingRate": 1.0,
        "sampleRateHertz": 48000
    }
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 48000,
  "responseMimeType": "application/jsonl",
  "jsonAudioFieldPath": "result.audioContent"
}
```

### Sarvam
Sarvam's TTS API returns json, so it requires an extra `jsonAudioFieldPath` field in your generic ExternalVoice.

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "api-subscription-key": "YOUR_SARVAM_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": {
    "text": "{text}",
    "targetLanguageCode": "en-IN",
    "speaker": "anushka",
    "model": "bulbul:v2",
    "pace": 1,
    "speechSampleRate": 24000,
    "outputAudioCodec": "linear16"
  },
  "responseSampleRate": 24000,
  "jsonAudioFieldPath": "audios"
}
```

## Testing Your Voice
We provide the [Preview Voice API](/api-reference/voices/voice-preview-post) that enables you to quickly test any external TTS provider. The API has built-in definitions for ElevenLabs, Cartesia, and LMNT. For any of the other TTS providers documented on this page, you can copy & paste the provided request bodies as the value for the `generic` object and then customize with your API key, voice ID, etc.

### Example: Inworld
Here's an example of what the request body to the Preview Voice API would look like for [Inworld](#inworld). You must replace `YOUR_INWORLD_BASIC_API_KEY` with your API key. You can also update the `voiceId` (i.e. `Hades`) with the voice you want to test.

```json
{
  "name": "MyInworldTest",
  "definition": {
    "generic": {
      "url": "https://api.inworld.ai/tts/v1/voice:stream",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Basic YOUR_INWORLD_BASIC_API_KEY"
      },
      "body": {
        "voiceId": "Hades",
        "modelId": "inworld-tts-1",
        "text": "{text}",
        "audioConfig": {
            "audioEncoding": "LINEAR16",
            "speakingRate": 1.0,
            "sampleRateHertz": 48000
        }
      },
      "responseSampleRate": 48000,
      "responseMimeType": "application/jsonl",
      "jsonAudioFieldPath": "result.audioContent"
    }
  }
}
```


## Debugging

If you start a call with an external voice and don't hear anything from the agent, your external voice is
probably misconfigured. You can figure out what's wrong using the [call event API](/api-reference/calls/calls-events-list).
Events are also visible when viewing the call in the Ultravox console.  Here are some common issues and their resolutions:
